<blockquote>Maybe wax in your ears isn't such a bad thing after all.</blockquote>

<p>You're a techno-savvy, Internet stomping, bit crushing computer
  nerd. You can cut code like King Kong climbs buildings. You can
  reinstall an OS on a dead system with nothing more than a QIC-24, a
  WYSE-50, a break-out box and a couple of paper clips. You <em>are</em>
  one of the Internet elite, the high priests of the holy Oracle. People
  bow down before you, and shower you with supplications and sacrifices.

<p>NOT. Your life is more like <a
  href="http://pfaff.newton.cam.ac.uk/ASR/adminspotting/">adminspotting</a>.
  That's because you live somewhere other than that holy mecca of
  meccas, Silicon Valley.  Every day you hear that there's gold in them
  thar hills of Californiay. Your old friends are driving BMW's, scoring
  Porche's with the proceeds from their second IPO and not returning
  your e-mails. You look around your grungy little cubicle in some dark
  and dreary office park outside some post industrial homogenized
  suburban planned community hell and say to yourself, "Self, it can't
  be much worse than this."  The Sirens call is alluring and
  irresistible.

<p>Oh, the ways of the Devil are many! I have made the journey, my
  friend. I have seen the Dark Side, the Left Coast. I did not turn away
  from all the ways that you can be tempted from the path of
  goodness. And there are many.

<h2>Living in the Strangest Place on Earth</h2>

<p>I moved to San Francisco in 1996, well, Los Gatos, which is South
  of San Jose, but that's close enough to the City and it has so much
  more cache than a former farm town with a silted in sea port. There
  were days when I thought that moving was the biggest mistake of my
  life, so far.  I thought that I knew what I was doing. I thought I had
  done my research, and performed "due diligence." I was wrong. No one
  can prepare you for the culture shock of moving from a suburb of
  Washington, D.C. to the epicenter of the Internet.

<p>First and foremost is the money. There's so much here, that greed is
  not just an occasional sin. It is a cultural institution. It rivals Wall
  Street. You are <em>supposed</em> to be greedy in this business. That's
  how <a href="http://www.webho.com/WealthClock"> Bill Gates got rich</a>,
  didn't he? That's how people who started Yahoo, Netscape, and Amazon.com
  did it, didn't they. Never mind that these companies have yet to show a
  significant profit. When your company IPO's, you're on the escalator to
  the holy land of American culture: the top tax bracket. So be prepared for
  the dark side (there's a dark side to this?!?) - greed follows the
  "Trickle Down Theory" even better than the money does. Everyone, every
  vendor, every home owner, every car dealer knows that anyone who knows a
  keyboard from a mouse probably has stock options out the wazoo and is
  really only wearing that greasy t-shirt and torn jeans because that's
  Valley chic. And all those young turks don't know zip about making a
  reasonable deal. They were raised on sticker prices and half off sales.
  While they were learning their trade, no one told them about negotiating
  basics. There's an enormous price inflation for just about everything.
  Theater tickets are $8.50, fuel is $1.50/gal, food isn't cheap (even if
  the state is an agricultural exporter).

<h2>It's the economy, stupid</h2>

<p>If you're coming here, you're going to work for a startup.  Face
  it, why else would anyone move here to suffer all of this bizarre
  crud. Any idiot with an MBA and a business plan can get venture
  funding.  Remember that. There is so much money out here that the VC's
  are hard pressed to put it all to work. You do not have to sacrifice a
  penny. In fact, if you're good, you should <em>demand</em> perks. The
  more chutzpah you've got, the more they seem to fall over you. Make
  sure that there's things like a well stocked refrigerator, telecommute
  policy (reimbursements for the xDSL, loans or loaner PCs, etc.)
  Remember too, that most startups <em>fail</em>, so don't count on
  those stock options until they're liquid!

<h2>Hi there, I'm a Capricorn with Java, C++ and ODBC, what's your sign?</h2>

<p>It's a tight market, salaries are high, talent is in short supply. You
  don't need a recruiter, they <em>need</em> you. I have yet to meet one
  that has done anything favorable. I have heard and seen many who are
  unethical, slimy bottom feeders that will do just about anything to make
  their commission. Work directly with employers and make a deal for a
  sign-on bonus. Recruiters make 15%-25% of the first year's salary.
  Eliminate the middle man and take your cut. Unfortunately, a lot of
  startups won't pay for a relocation (why, I don't know, it is probably too
  much for their brains to handle). If you hire onto a big company, they
  will move you, all expenses paid.

<p>If you're doing sysadmin you've got these classes of choices: (1)
  You can be a hired gun for <a href="http://www.taos.com/">Taos
    Mountain</a>. They are the big sysadmin contract company here. I'd
  work for them. I could go on about their business model, but I won't
  bore you. You work on a contract from 6 to 12 months, then you move on
  or convert to full time at the customer (and Taos gets their cut).
  The other company out here is <a
    href="http://www.gnac.com/">GNAC</a>. They started out as mostly
  ex-Synopsys folks, but they've grown.

<p>(2) You could work for an established, publicly traded company (HP,
  Intel, Cisco, Sun, etc.) Then you work in a large organization, doing
  the usual stuff, getting stock options to purchase the company stock
  at about a 15% discount (it is usually set at 15% of the lower closing
  price in a six month "window") They will also match your 401(k)
  contributions, something a startup <em>won't</em>. You get to haul big
  WAN pipes and large compute farms.  It is just like Adminspotting.

<p>(3) You could work for a startup. Hopefully a well funded one. Then
  you get to design the network and computing infrastructure, haul
  monitors and power strips and basically do what you want because
  everyone is too busy to worry about it or plan ahead. You'll get stock
  options that <em>might</em> be worth something some day, but your
  purchase price is anywhere from ($0.15 - 3.00) per share. If the stock
  IPO's at $40 per share, you've made a handy profit. If it does well,
  we'll start calling you "Joe Supernerd, Millionaire. He owns a mansion
  and yacht." Of course you have to wait until you're vested; that's
  usually 4 years.

<p>(4) You could parlay your sysadmin skills into a product, hence my
  friends at <a href="http://www.webtv.com/">WebTV</a> and <a
    href="http://www.brightmail.com/">Brightmail</a>, etc. This is the really
  fun stuff, I'll admit.

<p>I don't see much difference between 2 and 3, personally, except for the
  money. Stock options on a pre-IPO startup have a very high value <em>once
    the company goes public</em>. The difference in your cost versus IPO
  pricing is generally a multiplier in the 100's to 10,000's range. Compare
  with working for Cisco, where you get a guaranteed 15% discount on your
  purchase, but the stock (only) doubles every year or so.  Oh, and you'll
  get the same salary at both because the market is so hot they can't afford
  to short change you with the lure of future rewards. So why not go for
  door #3?  (Barring 1 & 4)

<p><a href="http://www.banking.com/aba/profile_0397.htm">Willie "The
  Actor" Sutton</a> perhaps said, "Why did I rob banks? Because that's
  where the money is."  (Or something like that. Maybe.) You can try the
  cold call and "I'll be in the neighborhood" plan, but if it doesn't pan out
  (and HR departments are just as lame here as anywhere else; you want
  to be face to face with the hiring manager), here's my "serving
  suggestion:" go to a conference (<a
    href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa99/">LISA</a>, USENIX, etc.)
  where like minded people will be hanging out. Bring a pile of
  resumes. Schmooze at the hospitality suites (which are written off as
  recruiting expenses). Follow up a week later and "let" them fly you
  out.  You <em>can</em> try to schedule them all for the same week, but
  then <em>none</em> of them will want to fly you out. I'd scam 'em:
  Have one buy you a ticket leaving early in the week, and another with
  a return flight late in the week.  Throw away the unused halves. Don't
  tell them what's going on and just switch hotels.

<p>The other option is to store everything back East, "move" here, stay with
  friends while you look for work and then have the company ship your stuff
  here. Think of it as an extended working vacation. Another variant is to
  work for a contractor like Taos. Then you're only committed for six months
  to any bozo, and while you're here, you can make contacts and look around
  for something more permanent. This is a classic, time tested approach.

<h2>I don't think we're in Kansas any more, Toto</h2>

<p>Now that you've stressed about the job market, it is time to really
  crank up your blood pressure: real estate aka, where the f*ck am I going
  to find a place to live?

<p>The way I found a place to live was my first employer put me up in
  executive housing for a month while I worked and looked for a permanent
  residence.  In retrospect, there were not enough hours in the day and I
  would have preferred not to start work for a couple of extra weeks while I
  looked.  This is a recurring theme, employers will hire you on half a days
  worth of interviews, but they want you to start yesterday. <em>Insist</em>
  on at least two weeks of transition time. When push comes to shove, most
  employers will let you have the time off. The ones that won't aren't worth
  your time.  Another plan is to have the company pay for a trip
  <em>prior</em> to the move. Friends, visiting, touring helps. There are
  relocation companies that will help you find a neighborhood but they have
  a limited imagination. I said I wanted a place to live that was walking
  distance to a good cappuccino. I found it in Los Gatos. This is such a big
  area and there is so much diversity that it is almost impossible to see
  and do it all in a short period. If you like cities and can swing it, I'd
  say live in San Francisco. It is getting gentrified - the poor are being
  pushed out to make room for all us highly paid nerds. If you can avoid
  owning a car, then you are golden.  Owning a car in the City unless you
  own a spot or a garage seems to be very difficult.

<p>The corporate movers deal with much bigger fish than you (imagine a
  house, large family, pets, big shot corporate exec, etc.) When you
  move, all your stuff goes into the truck. It will be shipped to a
  warehouse and stored there for 30 days (or until you find a place,
  whichever comes first). I had my car shipped, too, by the way, and
  flew. Much less wear and tear on you, the car and the cat. If you want
  to do the cross country road trip, though, by all means, this is your
  golden (paid!) opportunity.

<p>Remember, my company paid for <em>everything</em> (except for tips,
  which I generously and happily distributed). The packers came in the
  day before and wrapped, padded, boxed, crated and packed
  everything. My father helped me on the Virginia end. The big thing is
  that you have to keep track of what they're doing. You will get lots of
  paperwork to sign including a bill of lading. If it ain't on the list,
  then it doesn't exist. It helps if there is someone else there with
  you so you're free to supervise. Especially as things get moved onto
  the truck. You will get a large packet of instructions beforehand from
  the movers and the relocation company. This has all been done before a
  thousand times.

<p>I then had about a week while the truck picked up more stuff (all my stuff
  fit in the "head" of the truck) and headed west. I took the time to clean
  out the condo, get it ready for the tenant (I rented it out), etc. I
  lived in the executive suite in Herndon for that time. I didn't tell them
  about the cat. Then one snowy Friday morning, I hugged by Dad good-bye,
  hopped into a shuttle with a ton of suitcases and foot lockers, etc. gave
  my cat a little "helper" (they now have anti-depressant drugs for cats
  with travel anxiety -- I am not making this up!) and got on the plane.
  When I arrived at SFO, the rental car company (not Hertz, but some
  off-airport long term deal) was there to pick me up. I loaded everything
  into the van and away I went.

<h2>Be afraid, be very afraid</h2>

<p>Be prepared, even though you can't be, for sticker shock. Rent here is
  astronomical for a single person moving here from almost
  anywhere. Unless you've got $120,000 <em>cash</em> in the bank and ready to
  jump into a $500,000 mortgage, or accept living far, far, away from the
  office, you <em>will</em> rent at exorbitant prices. You'll be happy
  to find $1,200-1,500 for a 1 bedroom postage stamp in an okay
  neighborhood. The rents rival New York City. Landlords smell blood. If
  you are very, very lucky, you will find a nice one (surprisingly,
  there are lot of them out there); he won't raise your rent by 25%
  every year. When I first moved here, I got what I wanted by offering
  first and last months' rent, plus <em>six months in advance</em>, cash. That's
  probably overkill, but it got me to the front of the line. Lines? Yup,
  people line up to hand in rental applications like it was a sneak
  preview of Star Wars: Episode 2. People show up 15 minutes early and
  the line already stretched 30 people long around the corner.

<p>Imagine 30 people handing in applications for (in my case) a 2BR/1BA
  cottage in Los Gatos. Everyone seems to be driving a BMW, have an
  immaculate credit record and a $150K/year annual income (all disclosed
  on the application, by the way). How is the landlord going to
  distinguish you, an outsider with no local references with some DINC
  (double-income, no children) couple who's lived in Cupertino for the
  past 5 years? Trust me, we all look alike. I had a "housing resume"
  printed up which had work, salary and housing history in a nice
  package. It politely screamed: "I'm making enough to afford this, I
  won't trash the place and I pay my rent on time."  And as I handed it
  in, I told the guy, "I really like the place, I want it. Would six
  months' rent in advance get me to the front of the line?"  People have
  <em>bidding</em> wars on the friggin' rent! I wanted none of that and I
  figured a big fat check was more enticing than another $50 bucks a
  month in the rent.

<p>Once I had the contract for the rental in my hot little hand, I
  called the relocation coordinator (or the moving company dispatcher, I
  forget) and gave them the address. When they arrived, they unloaded
  and delivered. I wasn't sure where I wanted things, so I asked to
  leave a lot of stuff in boxes, which was okay by them. It would have
  been easier if they had done the unboxing, because they will then also
  take the boxes <em>away</em>. Do you know how many empty boxes you can
  fit in the back of Toyota Celica? Not many, even folded. I was pretty
  much on my own then, but life would have been much easier if there was
  someone else I trusted (and knew my tastes somewhat) to help supervise
  the movers.

<p>So, it's  not all that bad.  As I've said before,  location is very
  key out here. It is my personal opinion that you should choose a place
  (area)  to live,  <em>first</em>,  then  a place  to  work, close  by,
  second. Then get the company to  move you.

<h2>Where the road warrior got his start</h2>

<p>Be prepared for lots of driving, well commuting, since you're likely as
  not to be <a href="http://www.etaktraffic.com/pix/">crawling down the
    Nimitz or standing still on the Bay Bridge</a>. My friend with the Boxter
  says he hits his max speeds on the clover leafs and on ramps. I have
  co-workers that live in Morgan Hill and leave for work at 6:00 am. That
  would drive my postal. I commute, telecommute, and drive from Alameda to
  Mountain View (because I like living in Alameda), and it is easily an hour
  each way (2.5 if I use mass transit). And I'm almost postal. Your car
  becomes your second home. [Update: As of November 1999, I take the
  ferry into the City each day. It is a very civilized commute.]

<p>Don't expect to work on your tan while driving either. The sun
  shines only during the summer, once you're south of San Bruno, and after
  the fog burns off (could be 9am-1pm). Now, I drive the limit (okay, a
  little over) here most of the time. But it is mostly freeway
  miles. They have sound barriers up on both sides of most of the major
  routes, so there's not much to see. The mountains in the distance are
  nice. 280 is great. The approaches to the San Rafael and Dumbarton
  bridges are wildlife preserves and salt water evaporation ponds. At
  dawn and dusk they are wonderful, but it is tough to find a place to
  stop. Driving in Marin is very pretty, so is Skyline Drive (Rt 9). If
  you like motorcycles you can find all sorts of fun spots.

<p>The bay area has a <a href="http://www.transitinfo.org/">mass
  transit problem</a> - none of the systems interconnect any place
  useful.  The San Francisco bus and light rail system (MUNI) is <a
    href="http://www.sfweekly.com/extra/worst/muni.html">generally
    reviled for poor performance</a>. Generally there's a lot of
  sprawl. Also, people tend not to cross the bay, even though the toll
  ($2 westbound only) is small. That said, the people that do cross the
  Bay clog the bridges each morning and night.

<h2>Another face in the crowd</h2>

<p>The hardest thing for me was to adjust to the California
  attitude. I'm a New Yorker at heart, and that's probably to my
  detriment here. Californians don't have the same sense of "personal
  space" as Right Coasters do. You'll come here, you'll think you're
  making bosom buddies left and right and it's all
  <em>style</em>. Making friends here takes the same effort as always,
  but there's this weird veneer. I prefer the in-your-face New Yorker
  style. At least you know where you stand at all times, even if you do
  get insulted from time to time.

<p>One thing in the City's favor is San Francisco's history of
  permissiveness.  People do a lot of partying and hot-tubbing and are
  very accepting of whatever your kink might be.  The bay area is a very
  diverse place to live.  People come from every ethnicity and
  background, which may be a strength. It reminds me a bit of
  Adams-Morgan.

<h2>Even Seattle gets some sun sometimes</h2>

<p>The bay area has two seasons: wet and dry.  The wet season is from
  late December through mid March (neglecting El Nino and La Nina).  It
  will rain 5 days out of 6, though the rain is nothing like the fierce
  thunderstorms back east.  It is more the plodding depressing rains
  which just make everything damp and cold. The dry season, which is the
  rest of the year, will see little to no precipitation, though lots of
  fog and wind (which is another reason why I moved here - the sailing
  is incredible).  The bay area is full of micro-climates.  Pacifica is
  one of the most foggy/cool places to be.  If you live in San Jose it's
  almost always classic California sunny. For any other weather, you
  drive to it (which you can, in less than four hours). Wanna go skiing,
  no problem - Tahoe is thataway. Wanna go surfing, no problem - Santa
  Cruz is thisaway. Oddly enough, for all the recreational opportunities
  here, I'm so overworked most of the time that I have no energy left
  to enjoy it.

<h2>Life, the universe, everything</h2>

<p>I wouldn't go back. I couldn't go back. Then again, I love living
  on my boat and San Francisco Bay is one the world's premiere sailing
  locations.  People say that if you can survive the first 2 years,
  you'll be here forever. For me, the first six months were pure
  hell. The next six were tolerable. The second year was the best I ever
  had (fell madly in love, proposed, engaged, bought the boat, etc.),
  and now, in my third year, it is pretty darn nifty. I can't wait to go
  sailing to Mexico, though.

  For an alternative opinion, here's what my friend Hal has to say:

<blockquote>

  <p>I would move back in a heartbeat.  I've been here for 2.5 years
    now.  All my family lives in New York and I miss the bejeezus out of
    them.  I've got a great deal where I'm working, and I'm involved with
    a cause I believe in (<a href="http://www.brightlight.com">stopping
      spam</a>) so I'm going to wait out the IPO, but once I've cashed in
    I'm gone.  The other thing which keeps me here is the people at the
    sailing school I work at some weekends.

</blockquote>
