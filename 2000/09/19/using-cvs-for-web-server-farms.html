      <h1>Using CVS for Web Server Farms</h1>
<p class="subtitle">September 19, 2000</p>

<p>Let's assume that you've adopted the techniques described in <a
  href="http://www.arsdigita.com/asj/cvs">Using CVS for Web Development</a>
  (or <a href="http://durak.org/cvswebsites/">[Dreilinger]</a>) and you
  <em>are</em>
  the Release Master. Now imagine that instead of one web server you have a
  web server farm of 10 or 100. How do you prevent chaos and carpal tunnel
  syndrome from keeping you chained at your desk for days on end? Does this
  look familiar:

<ol>
  <li>Log onto the web server
  <li>Use CVS to checkout a new release, into a separate directory
    from the currently running production code
  <li><em>Quickly</em> update your data model and switch directories
  <li>Restart the server
  <li>Check that the new server is running okay
  <li>Log out of the web server
  <li>Go to step 1 until you run out of servers
</ol>

Does this look like an algorithm to you, too?

<h3>The way out of the madness</h3>

<p>Part of the problem of scripting a process like this is that there
  is a certain amount of uncertainty about what responses might be
  returned by the various tools necessary to accomplish the task. You
  don't want to blindly continue, because that might bring your site
  down. Enter a new tool to your quiver: <a
    href="http://expect.nist.gov/">Expect</a>. It is a tool for automating
  interactive applications. Part of the Expect release is a sample
  script, <cite>passmass</cite>, which demonstrates how to change a user
  password on multiple systems (that are not using NIS or Kerberos, of
  course). With just a few modifications, a new script was born, <a
    href="cvsmass.txt">cvsmass</a><a href="/cgi-bin/man.cgi?cvsmass">(1)</a> which performs (almost)
  all of the tasks listed above.

<p><code>cvsmass</code> knows how to log onto remote machines in various
  ways (telnet, rlogin, slogin, ssh). It will ask you for the remote
  password, if it is needed, and then reuse it for each subsequent
  server (this assumes that you use the same password on each
  system). Once the shell session is started, it will change into a
  directory (e.g. <code>/webroot</code>) and then run any program
  that you specify (<code>cvs update</code> by default).

<p>You'll also need a couple of utility shell scripts: <a
  href="cvs-pull-snapshot.txt">cvs-pull-snapshot</a> which pulls a
  release from the CVS repository and <a
    href="switchrel.txt">switchrel</a> which will switch a release
  directory on the production server. I am making the assumption that
  you have a symbolic link, which is the name used in your server config
  files and that it points to a date-stamped directory. These scripts are
  heavily customized for my site, so you must modify them to suit your
  needs.

<p>Once the tools are installed, here's the general process:

<ol>
  <li>I'll assume that the Release Master has created a branch in the
    CVS repository. We usually call ours
    <code>Snapshot-<i>yyyy-mm-dd</i></code>.
  <li>Run <code>cvsmass</code> to pull the snapshot onto each server:
<pre>
cvsmass -dir . -program 'cvs-pull-snapshot.sh <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>' webserv1 webserv2 ...
</pre>
    <p>The utility script extracts the release into a directory with a
      date extension (<i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>) so it won't conflict with the
      running release. The date is also part of the CVS tag, so the
      two are related. Depending on how many servers need to be
      updated, this can take anywhere from minutes to hours, but so
      what? You can do this well before the cutover is scheduled.
  <li>Now that the new release is available on each of the servers,
    you must go to each of the server, switch a few symbolic links
    and restart the servers.
      <pre>
cd /web
switchrel <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>
<i>restart the server (usually kill `cat nspid`)</i>
</pre>
    I've considered scripting this part, too, but I'm too chicken to
    trust even my own tools. If switchrel fails, I want to be able
    go back and fix it before restarting the web server. In
    addition, our restart requires root privileges, which we grant
    by using <code>sudo</code>.
  <li>Check the server logs to make sure everything is okay, move to
    the next server and go back to step 3.
</ol>

<h3>Exceptions and variations</h3>

<h4>ssh magic</h4>
<p>In order to use CVS on production machines, you
  need to communicate with the CVS repository server. There
  may be no direct (unfirewalled) connection between the production
  network and the development network. Rightly so. What is required
  is a "RemoteForward" connection using ssh. This creates a local
  port binding on the remote machine that tunnels back to the local
  machine, and opens a connection to another service. <!--Here comes the
    cheesy ASCII diagram:-->
<blockquote>
<pre>
[dev(ssh)]      ==&gt; [webservN(sshd)]
[dev:2401(cvs)] &lt;== [webservN:2401(sshd, RemoteForward tunnel)]
</pre>
</blockquote>
On the production systems, it appears that there's a local
connection to a CVS server, in reality it is a tunnel back to the
development network via ssh. You can do this on the command line
by adding <code>-o&nbsp;'RemoteForward=2401&nbsp;dev:2401'</code> or you
can add it to your .ssh/config file, as I have:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Host = webserv*
RemoteForward = 2401 dev:2401
</pre>
</blockquote>
The only <i>caveat</i> to this is that if you want to open a
<em>second</em> shell to a webserv, you need to override the
RemoteForward (because there can only ever be one process that
binds to a particular port, in this case 2401). Add
<code>-o&nbsp;ClearAllForwardings=yes</code> to the ssh command line for second
and subsequent connections. You'll know that you that you've
forgotten to do this if you get an error message like:
<code>bind:&nbsp;Address&nbsp;already&nbsp;in&nbsp;use</code>

<h4>Updates that don't require a full release</h4>

<p><b>Scenario 1</b>: Your service is up an running just fine, and
  you need to make a minor change to half a dozen files. Do you make a
  whole new release? If not, how do you get the changes propagated out
  to all of the servers? The answer is simply run <code>cvs
    update</code> on all of your servers. If the changes don't change any
  function definitions or initializations, you can get away without
  restarting the servers at all.

<ol>
  <li>Your team makes the changes in the directories served by your
    stage server. They should be checked out using the same CVS tag
    as the one you used to make the original release. Once the
    changes are tested and QA'd, check them into the repository
    (either manually or a nightly cron job).
  <li>Run <code>cvsmass</code>, but this time the program to run will
    be <code>cvs update</code>.
      <pre>
cvsmass -dir www -program 'cvs -q up' webserv1 webserv2 ...
</pre>
</ol>

<p><b>Scenario 2</b>: You're running a service that has numerous
  co-brand arrangements. One of your customers has a legal requirement
  to be ever so slightly different that the rest of your site. It isn't
  worth creating a whole new body of code for it, so how do you keep
  track while still updating the site so it is in sync with the rest of
  the world.

<p>It should be no surprise that I've had to deal with this problem
  first hand. We had to comment out one line of HTML code on one group
  of servers. It was a rush job, so we made all of the changes on the
  live production system. Here's what we did:

<ol>
  <li>Edited the offending code
  <li>Ran <code>cvs diff -u &gt; patchfile</code>
  <li>Saved <i>patchfile</i> in a common spot (we have a few
    directories NFS mounted for utilities and such).
  <li>Ran <code>cvsmass</code> to run the <code>patch</code> program
    on each of the servers
      <pre>
cvsmass -dir www/bus -program 'patch -b &lt; $HOME/patchfile' webserv4 webserv5 ...
</pre>
</ol>

<p>An interesting note is that when we do minor updates, as in
  Scenario 1, the patch we made does not disappear. CVS is smart enough
  to apply incremental changes without wiping out any local
  modifications (it uses the same code as patch internally). On the
  other hand, we have a large note to remind ourselves to re-apply this
  patch every time we roll out a new release into new directories.

<h3>Some advantages and things that could be done better</h3>

<p>It never fails that about 2 hours before I'm scheduled to switch to
  a new release, a developer comes running in with a last minute fix or
  modification. In the bad old days, I'd have to re-roll a tar ball and
  scp it to every server in the farm (and in those days there were fewer
  servers in the farm to begin with). Now, it's a no brainer. I just
  check the changes in (it did take a good month of nagging before the
  HTML folks got the idea that they had to make changes in the staging
  area), and run an update script that calls cvsmass with the
  appropriate arguments.

<p>Rollbacks (in case the sh*t really hits the fan) are just the same
  as a release: call switchrel with the previous release date, restart
  the servers, lather rinse repeat.

<p>It would be nice if I had also written a script that does the
  switching and restarting, but, at least in my current situation, it
  pays to go slow. We are using Cisco LocalDirector to load balance the
  traffic. If a site goes down (during a restart) it is taken out of the
  load balance pool for a few minutes. That is just about enough time
  for me to move (logout, login, cd, start a 'tail&nbsp;-f') from one server
  to the next, so we never have more than one server offline at a time,
  and we never really go "off the air."

<p>My only one, true regret is that the name 'cvsmass' is a little
  inappropriate since CVS is not integral to its function, but I can't come
  up with a better name in any fewer characters.
