      <h1>On a Lighter Note</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 28, 1997</p>

    <p>Home port, Peninsula Marina, Redwood City, US<br>
      <a href="http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapsurfer?infact=2&outfact=2&act=place&tlevel=-&tvar=-&tmeth=i&mlat=&mlon=&msym=redpin&mlabel=Peninsula+Marina&murl=&lat=37.5044022&lon=-122.2129211&wid=0.090&ht=0.033&conf=mapnew.con&map.x=178&map.y=211">37N29.55' 122W15.98'</a>

    <p>Neither Suzy, nor I are early risers. Good thing too, because after last
      nights Thanksgiving meal at Bill's mom's, we needed some extra time to
      digest. I felt like lying on a warm rock for a couple of weeks. This is not
      to say that all we did was <em>sleep</em> ;-). More on that when I have
      more infrastructure for adult material.

    <p>It was a perfect lazy day off. We ate almost all of the leftovers that we
      brought home from the night before! Of course it was breakfast <em>and</em>
      lunch... We finally got around to measuring the main traveller track. It
      seems that the mounting holes are neither the "standard" American size, nor the metric one
      for the rest of the world. We sent e-mail to Ronstan in Australia asking if
      their fittings would work on this track; otherwise, it is going to be a lot
      of work to take off the old track and install the new one. Meanwhile, all
      of the expensive Harken gear I bought last month are still in boxes.

    <p>We got the old boat name lettering off of the port side today. With Suzy
      and I switching off between peeling the vinyl letters off and operating the
      hair dryer we managed to get them off without scorching our fingers too
      much.

    <p>We filled a couple of cups with wine and took a sunset walk through Bair
      Island. It is amazing what you can see, just in your own backyard. A few
      birds were hunting: They would flap their wings about 50 feet off the
      ground, just holding station, waiting for whatever it is they were hunting
      for to come out of hiding. Then they would flare their wings and float
      straight down so as not to make any noise and drop down on their victim. We
      don't know if they ever managed to catch dinner, but it was a sight to see.
      Suzy says that there's a bird in the Marquesas that does something very
      similar: they fly in backward circles as part of their mating rituals.

    <p>Dinner time, and a little excitement. &quot;What would you like for
      dinner?&quot; Suzy says. &quot;I can't believe I'm hungry
      <em>again</em>.&quot; &quot;Well it has been six hours, it's time. What
      would you like to eat? We've got that pizza shell, and some
      vegetables...&quot; &quot;How about I cook dinner tonight? It would be a
      first. I can handle the pizza&quot;

    <p>Recipe for salad bar pizza

    <UL>
      <LI> One ready made pizza shell
      <LI> Tomato sauce (or any other sauce)
      <LI> Cheese
      <LI> Your favorites from the salad bar (or leftovers from the fridge)
    </UL>

    <p>Combine all of the ingredients and bake. I hate vegetable prep. I love
      vegetables, I just hate cleaning, peeling, chopping and dicing them. I
      figure that rather than skip cooking, I can pay the premium at the salad
      bar for someone else to do my vegetable prep for me. This works even better
      for recipes that require four pounds of deveined spinach!

    <p>Anyway, that's how it started. I'd never used the oven before, so Suzy
      was showing me how. The boat uses a liquid propane gas system, exactly the
      same as your barbecue grill. LPG, unfortunately is heavier than air, so you
      don't want it flowing around the boat unattended. There are several valves
      between the LPG bottle mounted in the stern and the oven. You have to open
      them all to get a flame. This is good. You also have to do the moral
      equivalent of relighting the pilot light every time too. This is not so
      good. First you turn on all but the oven valve, then you crawl on your
      knees and light the pilot with a cigarette lighter and wait for the element to heat up enough to
      start cooking. It is a good idea to check that the flame is really going
      otherwise you could have a nasty little surprise.

    <p>Everything looks fine. I'm preheating the oven to 450F. Meanwhile, I'm
      taking almost everything (or so it seemed) out of the refer just to get at
      the vegetables. How does Suzy do this??? So with all of the fixings out on
      every available horizontal surface, I turn to ask Suzy, &quot;I hope I get
      used to this before we try this under way?&quot; when<br>

    <H1>PHOOOM!</H1>

    <p>There is a bright yellow flame shooting out from the oven. Before my
      heart starts beating like crazy, I reach for the gas cutoff switch and
      shut everything down. We're still in one piece, but there are these little
      pieces of black creosote looking things floating onto the cabin sole. Suzy
      starts picking up the little bits and taking them outside before they affix
      themselves to every clean surface on the boat. I grab a paper towel and
      pick up the rest. Then I grab a flashlight and look inside the oven for
      more floating black bits. It looks clear, so far so good. We're trying to
      figure out why this happened. The oven has been used many times since we
      bought the boat and this has never happened before, not even a hint.
      I'm wondering if the surveyor missed something. Well, no time like the
      present. I carefully open the oven door, sniffing for gas or other noxious
      odors and right away, just underneath the pilot light I see the cause of the problem:
      remember that cigarette lighter I used to light the oven? We've learned
      empirically that plastic butane cigarette lighters will melt, fail and
      explode at roughly 200F. Ooops.

    <p>
      Both of us are laughing hysterically on the floor from a combination of
      relief and adrenaline rush. The rest of dinner goes without a hitch but
      Suzy has made me promise never to make pizza flamb&eacute; again.

    <P>Wishful Thinking? Maybe, you decide.
