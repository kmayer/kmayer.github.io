      <h1>Annual Performance Reviews Suck -- We Won't Do Them</h1>
<p class="subtitle">July 10, 2017</p>

<p>After more than 30 years in the working world, I can not find a single person that likes annual performance reviews; neither management nor direct reports. No one thinks that they are a healthy way of providing feedback. So we won’t do them. At PacerPro, you will know how you are doing with continuous feedback. You will be compensated fairly (since I don’t have unicorn budgets) and adjusted as needed by both employer and employee.</p>

  <p>Me: To this day, I can not find a single person that likes annual performance reviews, neither management nor direct reports. No one thinks that they are a healthy way of providing feedback. So why the flock do we torture ourselves? Is it a cargo-cult thing where “we’ve always done annual reviews, that’s just the way it is?” or is there some higher level business reason?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: I totally agree with you! Especially since research has shown that the most effective feedback is that provided within a short time frame of the event. I believe the performance review and $$ increase process is one of those things that is full of sticky wickets and so entrenched in workplace culture that it will take a long time to change in the larger arena. But there are companies - few and far between - that are experimenting with different approaches while maintaining adherence to a convoluted, complex and enormous body of law+regulations+court/administrative rulings.*</p>

<h1 id="risk-management-issues-cloud-our-judgement">Risk Management Issues Cloud Our Judgement</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: What are the key attributes designed to reduce risk? Documentation for one. The appearance of fairness (maybe even equality - which is impossible) for another. Everyone in a job classification (technical term) should be evaluated on the same basis; perhaps there have been court rulings that have led to this being interpreted into processes that involve all that crap we both detest. Job descriptions &gt; standards of evaluation &gt; format and timing of evaluation  &gt; application of those evaluations, and all subsequent employment decisions (pay decisions, promotion, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: The regulatory environment has become so onerous that these same conservative HR teams don’t update job descriptions regularly because of all the stuff they believe must be included in job descriptions so as to land on the right side of the judgement if unfair employment practice cases come before a court; or California’s or Fed EEO agencies come a-knocking in response to a complaint. Or, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance - the federal regulatory agency charged with overseeing nearly all regulations in the workplace, including employment-related - demands to review employment records to determine the level to which an employer is complying with said regulations. (This happens to companies who do in excess of $50k business annually with the feds - that was the threshold in 2005, and probably hasn’t changed.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>LTO: To be honest Ken, most of the organizations and talent people I deal with agree with you.  There are some organizations – mostly those that don’t focus on talent development, that cling tightly to the need for performance reviews.  The question I  always ask my clients is “is the performance review tied to compensation”.  Those that say yes are going down a slippery slope and generally find the whole process excruciating.  People get very touchy when their bonus is tied to peer reviews and “bosses that are out to get me” and “subjective evaluations”.  Most of those I am working with are – to some degree or another, looking at the need for development and the best way to do that.
LTO: I think it depends where they are in the maturity spectrum and how much infrastructure they have in place.  The important things to have in place are calibration so that a person would be objectively seen to be doing an outstanding job and ready for next level across the company.  There is also the need for succession planning.  The ole 9 box. Organizations that are growing rapidly need to have a steady stream of bench ready talent for growth and the 9 box helps identify who is ready and who is still in need of development.  Then there has to be the structure to actually develop people.  Identify Hi potentials for assignments, identify what skills a person needs to develop.     <br />
LTO: If organizations have the constant feedback loop in place, and this infrastructure for growth, then the performance review is not really needed.  Then they just have to take the leap!</p>

<h1 id="larger-organizations">Larger Organizations</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: A point about documentation: not only is it important in the event of a charge of unfair employment practice; it’s incredibly valuable when an employee goes from one manager to another, or gets promoted - employees often take time to adapt to new situations, and performance may change - wouldn’t the current manager want to know the employee’s history? Or as a reference in the event of minor disagreements…</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="compensation-budgets">Compensation, Budgets</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: Alas, the days of healthy merit increases went away when the focus changed from operational efficiency to shareholder value. I believe that is the root of most of the evil in current corporate compensation practices. Comp budgets haven’t moved more than 2-4% since the mid-1990s. Instead, the Fortune 500 set the pace for more “variable pay” programs (bonus &amp; incentives); and “total compensation” - educating employees about the true cost of the benefits packages they receive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="what-does-performance-really-mean">What does “Performance” really mean?</h1>

<p>If you have performance goals, what does “good” (“great,” “poor,” etc.) performance mean in terms of personal career growth on one side and company growth on the other side? Making up measurable goals still don’t mean much even if you do make them if they don’t move the needle. Great employees know what’s important and benefits both themselves and the company. Good employees acts on what benefits the company. Everyone else will be offered a generous severance package.</p>

<h1 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: In every. single. case, the discussion is documented - this is where forms can be handy. Not everyone has the same discipline or style to conduct these conversations, so forms assist in consistency, but they’re not fullproof. Some people managers need training and subsequent follow-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="bonuses">Bonuses</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: Either a boost to annual pay or a bonus program that is paid out according to the metrics. 
     If a bonus program, the tax hit is higher than with regular pay - about 50% between the state and the feds. So if this is the route - then announce the bonus in net terms, not grossed up.  You could do a combination. You could also do like Pivotal did - spot bonuses, or gift certificates to Amazon (or whatever). This latter is treated by IRS/FTB differently than pay or bonus, would need to talk to the accounting people…give thought and be consistent about the standards for spot bonuses vs. gift rewards</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="what-motivates-people">What Motivates People?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>F: Non-cash rewards are underrated. Recognition in front of colleagues and/or management is really important. Responsiveness to employees is also incredibly important. Employees want to be listened to. They want to know they’re contributing. They want to hear that their contribution is worthwhile. They want to make a difference. It doesn’t matter what age cohort they’re in - these fundamentals never change, but the way in which they’re addressed might change.</p>

  <p>F: For 25 years, the research - both valid/reliable + stuff like Glass Door - shows that reason #1 people leave an organization is because of their boss or the management. See point above about employee perceptions of fairness (decision-making) and performance reviews.

<h1 id="notecards">Notecards</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Annual compensation budgets grow between 2-4% per capita.</li>
  <li>Managers should learn how to negotiate salaries. It’s an important skill.</li>
  <li>Individual contributors should know their worth and be happy with their compensation.</li>
  <li>Individual contributors will someday become leaders and will need to be able to negotiate. Compensation is one that is fraught with complexity and subjective points of view. Excellent training.</li>
  <li>Everyone should be given formal training in negotiating.</li>
  <li>The data is available: PayScale.com, Glassdoor.com, Comparably.com</li>

<h1 id="annecdote">Annecdote</h1>

<p>My step-father told me this story about his early days. I just got offered a job making sixty cents an hour and I told my boss that I thought it was kind of low. He said that if I worked hard and showed my worth, that I’d get a raise when I deserve it. So, I worked hard and got really good at my job and a year goes by and – no raise. I thought maybe I wasn’t good enough. A little later the boss’s brother shows up on a Saturday morning, sees me working overtime, and asks me, “Mo, you’re a great guy, why are we still paying you sixty cents an hour?” So I tell him that his brother said he would give me a raise when I deserve it. He laughs until he’s apoplectic and says, “Mo, you idiot, you won’t deserve it <em>until</em> you ask for it!” So that’s my lesson.</p>
