      <h1>Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be brogrammers</h1>
<p class="subtitle">June 2, 2016</p>


<p>This is a letter to my boys, and to all my other sons and brothers. You may not like what I have to say, but keep reading. Even if you do agree, don’t just accept, re-tweet and carry on. We all carry the responsibility to make things better.</p>

<p>This is about the work place and relationships. Mostly about public gatherings like professional conferences, since that’s what I know about, mostly. But it really does apply everywhere. Ready? Here we go.</p>

<p>First of all, let me apologize. We fucked up. We, your parents, that is. We should have made this world a better place for you by now, but no matter how much we tried, it wasn’t enough; there were unintended consequences; and the problems really are much too big for any single generation to fix. So, it’s up to you to pick up the ball make things better, even a little better. Did you know that’s how a Jewish Paradise will come? Not by some magical mystical voodoo God coming down from on-high and whisking all the good people up in some fucked up E-ticket rapture ride. Nope, God said, “Paradise is what you make of it, that’s why I gave you free will in the first place, you big dopes. I’ll show up for coffee and knishes when you’ve got the place tidied up a bit more.” So let’s make some paradise on Earth where all of us can enjoy it.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-responsible-for-your-actions-even-if-she-says-yes">You are responsible for your actions, even if she says, “Yes.”</h2>

<p>Wat?</p>

<p>Yup. You are <em>personally</em> and <em>irrevocably</em> responsible for whatever you do, whenever, wherever. Even when she says, “Yes.” <em>Especially</em> if she says, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“But what about…”</p>

<p>Nope. It’s still on you.</p>

<p>“If she’s been…”</p>

<p>What part of “responsible” don’t you understand?</p>

<p>“When I was a growing up…”</p>

<p>Fuck that noise. We’re trying to make this a better place. Lame excuses for the past are unacceptable.</p>

<p>Let me put this another way, if some other bro’ did that to your sister, would it be okay? No? <em>Then DON’T fucking do it. It’s NOT okay!</em> Ever! Intentions be damned. You will be judged by your actions.</p>

<h2 id="youre-attending-a-professional-conference-act-like-a-professional">You’re attending a professional conference. Act like a professional.</h2>

<p>It’s not a pick-up joint, even at the after-parties. You are representing yourself, your company, and your family. Don’t do something that would shame them. When someone else is acting foolishly, don’t take advantage of them. And if they are your <em>friend</em>, for God’s sake, talk some sense into them. It is never okay to drink to excess, and by excess I mean loss of control. Honestly, I can’t think of any situation where this is appropriate although it may be more acceptable at a party with just friends, but even then… I know that alcohol reduces inhibitions, making it easier to be in social situations where you might be otherwise uncomfortable. Boozing is fun up to a point, then it gets destructive. At professional gatherings, however, none of this is acceptable. Frankly you should never get anywhere close to that line. Wobbly legs and slurred words does not give me confidence that you will be good to work with in the future.</p>

<h2 id="because-we-fucked-up-you-have-to-be-more-careful">Because we fucked up, you have to be more careful.</h2>

<p>Historically abused classes carry baggage. Sorry, that’s the way it is. If you’re in a privileged class, then don’t get all righteous about how “It’s not my fault that my grandfather was a slime ball misogynist dickhead.” Be kinder than you think you should be. Be aware that your mere presence may carry a threat of violence. Give people space, or even extra space. Don’t get angry with them. Everyone carries some inner pain that you know <em>nothing</em> about.</p>

<h2 id="check-your-own-baggage-for-hidden-assumptions">Check your own baggage for hidden assumptions</h2>

<p>Just because you’re talking to a woman does not mean she works in Human Resources. That’s insulting. Why not just <em>ask</em> her what she does? Is that so fucking hard? Being friendly does not imply attraction. An assertive woman is not bossy. A strong personality is not a bitch. These are things that we’ve absorbed almost without conscious thought. Being self-aware is very hard to do, but is the most worthwhile thing you could be in your life. You don’t have to “fix” everything. I don’t think that’s possible. You can <em>try</em> to be better. That’s all that I can hope for, really. Believe me, it’s a start and a bit better than the status quo.</p>

<h2 id="still-were-here-to-make-business-relationships">Still, we’re here to make business relationships</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be a given that others’ intentions are, in general, no better or worse than your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We go to these gatherings to meet people. At every conference I’ve ever been to, the “hallway track” has always been the most rewarding. That’s what you’re here for. I’ve made lifelong friendships this way, with people I love and respect. I keep telling myself that this is why the first two sigmas of people are here, too. If I had to go to these public gatherings feeling under constant threat, I’d lose my mind. So, give it your best shot and presume that most everyone around you has the same good intentions. Remember “Trust but verify?” Not everything that Reagan said was bullshit.</p>

<p>It always start with respect, son. Respect for yourself, respect for others. Do that; the rest is just commentary.</p>
