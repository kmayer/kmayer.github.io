      <h1>DropBox + Git => Designer &lt;3</h1>
<p class="subtitle">April 5, 2011</p>

<p>One of the thornier problems in our workflow is knowing when assets are delivered from the designer and keeping them in sync with our application as they change. We used to use e-mail, Skype or sticky notes. The trouble is that the designer's file naming and directory structure were never quite the same as the application's <code>/public/images</code> directory, so direct comparisons were impossible and we ended with a lot bookkeeping to make sure that we didn't lose any changes. Our solution is to <em>clone</em> the project's git repository into a folder inside a <em>shared</em> Dropbox folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is cheap, if not free, available on all platforms, and synchronizes easily across most network connections. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is, well, awesome version control. We already had a Dropbox account set up for the project, and all team members had accepted invitations to join the share. We then made a <code>git clone</code> of our application source code in the Dropbox folder;</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Dropbox/MyProject
git clone https://github.com/myproject/myapp git-repository</code></pre></figure>

<p>We took a minute or 2 to show the designer how to find the <code>images</code> directory, and our basic rationale behind naming and directory structure. That became her "new" assets folder. We did not show the designer how to use git, nor do we need to. As far as she is concerned, it is just another folder. <code>/public/images</code> is even a familiar place for designers.</p>

<p>Here's where the fun starts: We add the Dropbox/git-repository as a <code>remote</code> to our main project repository.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/myapp
git remote add dropbox file:///Users/me/Dropbox/MyProject/git-repository</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, as far as our main project is concerned, the Dropbox folder is another remote, just like github. </p>

<p>During our daily workflow, whenever we need a new asset, or to look for a changed one, we <code>cd</code> over to the Dropbox folder with the git repository, change into the <code>/public/images</code> directory and look for what we need. We then use <code>git add</code> to stage and commit <em>only</em> those assets that we need. Back in our main project, we then </p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git pull dropbox master</code></pre></figure>

<p>from the Dropbox remote and voila! New images! Later, if the designer makes changes, we can simply run <code>git status</code> to see what's changed, re-run git add, commit and pull. The only really gotcha is training our fingers not to type <code>git commit -am '...'</code></p>

<p>We have found this to be a very fast, lightweight, way of integrating new assets into the project and keeping track of old ones. The designer is no longer worried about getting out of sync with our project, nor are we worried about missing design changes. As a bonus, there's a history in the git logs, so we can review changes and even revert if necessary. All this without the designer ever learning a single git command, nor us worrying about our project directory getting accidentally clobbered. </p>

<p>[This is actually a <em>very</em> old trick that I've been using since the late 90's, but back then it was using CVS and NFS mounted shares!]</p>

<p>There are other benefits, too. Sometimes we'll make minor fixes to the images delivered to us. By adding a remote to the Dropbox git repos, we can <em>pull</em> from our application master and then the designer gets our fixes.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Dropbox/git-repository
git remote add myapp file:///Users/me/my app</code></pre></figure>

<p>Remember, it's just a git repos! You can alway revert or reset to previous versions. In the most terrible worst case, you delete the whole Dropbox directory and start "over," that is, at the HEAD of the repository master on github (or whereever).</p>
