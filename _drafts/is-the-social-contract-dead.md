title: "Is the social contract dead"

I wonder if I'm making a mistake teaching my kids to follow the rules and be nice to one another. Look at the "pinnacles" of our society: Zuckerface, Felon Musk, Drumpf, Jobs; assholes each and every one of them. The rules don't apply to them. That's for suckers. Nice guys will never finish ahead of the amoralistic jerk who doesn't give a fuck.

The trouble is, that if everyone acts like jerks, nothing will get done. It's called anarchy because there're no leaders.

The social contract is a bargain; do the right thing, be kind to another, follow the rules and we'll help you to a better life than if you were out on your own. That contract is broken in America.

I can't save enough, fast enough, to ensure a comfortable retirement.

I can barely afford health care, and I'm wealthy by all reasonable standards.

My kids basic education is constantly under attack and at risk.

My kids future is at risk.

Think about me, then think about those who are truly under attack; high school educated (by an education system that's been systematically gutted since the 60s), fungible jobs that can be exported overseas to a lower cost workforce. Retirement plans that can be raided by the rich. No wonder they're angry and won't take it any more. They don't understand that they are victims of decades of attacks from both parties. So they'll blame an easy target: Anyone who is different. That's our instinctual response to a tribal threat anyway.
