They shouldn’t, but you just can’t squash enough of them. Or the leak is so slow that it takes hours to manifest. The trouble with memory leaks is that they are permanent for the life of a process. Once a process has expanded its <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7880784/what-is-rss-and-vsz-in-linux-memory-management">VSZ</a>, there’s no way in Unix to shrink it. So your process starts to bloat, eventually your servers <a href="http://www.folkstalk.com/2011/11/swapping-and-paging-in-unix.html">page</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrash</a>. Performance tanks. Then your pager starts going off and there goes your beauty sleep.</p>

          <div><p>For any sufficiently large application, you want to minimize interruptions to service while deploying new code. This is especially challenging for migrations on Heroku and other Platforms-as-a-Service, where you have a Catch-22 problem; you want to run your migrations, <em>first</em>, but you can’t run them until you’ve deployed the migrations to production. Usually, at this point, your new migration-dependent features are in the deploy, too. So when your application restarts, and the migration hasn’t run, yet, your poor application will trip some exceptions, and perhaps, create problems for your users. Of course, you could put the app into maintenance mode, but that creates more downtime for your users.</p>

Invariably, it times out because the default settings on Heroku are (quite reasonably) for web / API interactions; anything longer than 30 seconds is too long and the connection should be closed to let other requests through. How do you get around this, then? You could set up your <code class="highlighter-rouge">database.yml</code> file so that you connect to your production database from a developer workstation. This is actually quite useful, but opens up a hellacious security hole. Let’s not get started about the consequences of accidentally running <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:drop:all</code>! Moreover, you want your system to be automated as much as possible, and that means running your tasks on a Heroku instance. Fortunately, with a little hackery, you can modify the connection timeout settings within your application. Do this carefully, and make sure that it can not leak into your running web application dynos.</p>

          <div><p>A few weeks ago, some of the managers got together for drinks after work. I started to reminisce about an old employer who had, what I thought, was an incredibly unique and reasonable way to handle the “vacation liability” problem. The old firm was a consulting firm, mostly military contracts, in the DC area. We were paid for every hour we billed, and we accrued vacation hours for every hour we were paid. It created an environment where the top performers could rack up so much vacation that they could not use it all. Many companies handle this with the familiar “use it or lose it” policy, which caps the accrued vacation hours to some limit. Instead, the firm let vacation accrue forever, with one modification: When you got a raise, your vacation hours were reduced by exactly the same percentage.</p>
