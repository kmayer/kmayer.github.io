        <br><span class="smaller">July 25, 2016</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>I am often asked about the meaning of things in Pivotal Tracker, such as “What’s the difference between a bug and a chore?” Or, “How can I tell the difference between a bug and a feature?” Another oldie but a goodie is, “What story should I pick from the backlog?” Here are my biased answers.</p>

        <div><p>On my current project, we're using RabbitMQ. It's a bit of infrastructure that has to be present, and if it isn't, our integration tests will fail with mysterious error messages. We want our tests to be informative, so let's write a test that asserts that we have the requisite infrastructure in place.</p>

        <div><p>If you've written enough integration tests (with Capybara <em>et al.</em>), you must have noticed how much time your tests spend just logging into your web app. Even if it takes 1 second each time, it starts to add up. Here's a solution that I've written several times, now. I create a test "jig" that allows me to authenticate into my application with a single <code>visit</code>.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">May 26, 2013</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>It is a time-honored tradition for Pivots to blog about their first few months at Pivotal. A typical day at Pivotal is <em>strong</em> work. It’s different from any previous job. It’s exhausting. After six weeks or so, however, the Pivots find their rhythm. I’m not going to write any more about that. I’ll include some links, below, so you can read them for yourself. I’m here to write about the two-years-later; When most developers are itching to move on to the next big thing. I’m still happily learning new stuff every day.</p>

        <div><p>Volatility is what Pivotal Tracker uses to measure the consistency of your team’s work output. You can use that number to help you estimate the first approximation to answer the eternal question, “Will I make the deadline?”</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">April 5, 2011</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>One of the thornier problems in our workflow is knowing when assets are delivered from the designer and keeping them in sync with our application as they change. We used to use e-mail, Skype or sticky notes. The trouble is that the designer's file naming and directory structure were never quite the same as the application's <code>/public/images</code> directory, so direct comparisons were impossible and we ended with a lot bookkeeping to make sure that we didn't lose any changes. Our solution is to <em>clone</em> the project's git repository into a folder inside a <em>shared</em> Dropbox folder.</p>
