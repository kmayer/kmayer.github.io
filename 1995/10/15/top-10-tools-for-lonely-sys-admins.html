<P><I>Reprinted from ;login: v20,n5, October 1995.</I></P>

<P>Here's my list of tools that I couldn't do without, in no particular
  order: </P>

<DL>
  <DT><BR>
    <B>A Logbook</B> </DT>

  <DD>Steve Simmons once said, &quot;I'm not brilliant, I've just got a good
    memory.&quot; [<I>;login:</I> J/F'93] Ditto. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>A Bernoulli Drive</B> (or some other brand of removable media disk drive)
  </DT>

  <DD>Because when you absolutely, positively need to boot from a gold copy
    configuration of version x.y.z of SomeOS, it beat s the heck out of hauling
    around a Seagate drive assembly. Spaf [<I>Eugene Spafford of Purdue University
      - Ed.]</I> also claims that (to date), no hacker, via the Internet, has
    been able to modify or otherwise soil a disk that is locked inside a safe
    with the write-protect tab set. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>A Portable CD-ROM drive</B> </DT>

  <DD>Ever notice how all the CD-ROM drives are in use just when you need
    to use one on an out-of-the way system that so happens to be missing one
    of its own? Also doubles as a handy entertainment system on those long
    lonely nights in the machine room while you're rebuilding a 2Gig hard drive
    from 2 weeks worth of backup tapes. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>The O'Reilly Sys Admin Bookshelf (<I>et al.</I>)</B> </DT>

  <DD>I remember making this a condition of employment (the other was annual
    attendance at LISA :-). Fast, portable, compatible - a good reference library
    is indispensable. And O'Reilly publishes some of the best. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>Perl</B> </DT>

  <DD>The Swiss Army Chain Saw of UNIX tools. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>A box of terminators, cables, adaptors for SCSI, Ethernet, RS-232/432,
      etc.</B> </DT>

  <DD>Remember last night (and it's always at night, isn't it?) when you
    need to hook up a Macintosh running SLIP to the back of a router so you
    could bring up a back-up DNS server (don't ask, you really don't want to
    know)? That gender mender came in handy. Standards are wonderful; there
    are so many to choose from. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>Problem/Request management/tracking software</B> </DT>

  <DD>Chapter 1 of every time management book I've ever read says that you
    need a single place to write down your tasks. Little Post-It&reg; notes
    and slips of paper hanging out of every nook and cranny won't cut it. This
    is probably where the term &quot;it must have dropped on the floor somewhere&quot;
    was coined. Tracking software <I>starts</I> automating some of your task
    logging. It also gives your users a consistent priority (some might say
    triage) scheme for requesting work. And a 15 page report of line items
    is a good thing to show to your boss at salary review time. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>A pager</B> </DT>

  <DD>I know this one is going to create a lot of controversy. [Note, since
    this article was published, there hasn't been any, so I guess more people
    agree on this than I thought. -KLM] A pager can be a tool, or it can be
    an electronic leash. The only people that know my pager number are my boss,
    his secretary, and some of the other division secretaries who make more
    than a few calls to me. I swear them all to secrecy (that's why they're
    called <I>secretaries</I>. If someone needs to get in touch with me, the
    secretaries can do a little prescreening for me.<br><br>

    I also got the person who maintains the company telephone system to
    create a voice-mail box that doesn't ring on any phone. I then programmed
    the box to call the pager (a nice built-in feature of our system). People
    call the v-mail box; I get a page a few minutes later. Then I can screen
    the message. The whole system disconnects the <I>person</I> (me) from the
    <I>service</I> (Help Desk) in time and space. If I'm away, someone else
    carries the pager (kind of an on-call), and users don't have to worry about
    calling a different number. (And I don't have to worry about retraining
    users.) </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>Telephone headset for hands-free talking (or talking with your hands
      ;-)</B> </DT>

  <DD>Since I got my headset, I don't mind staying on hold as much. Technical
    support calls don't wear me out either. </DD>

  <DT><BR>
    <B>A hobby (a.k.a. a life outside of work)</B> </DT>

  <DD>This is one is probably more important than the rest, but I saved the
    best for last. The best sys admins I know, the best engineers I know, heck,
    the most successful people I know, are the ones whose life is <I>not</I>
    defined by their work. Without waxing philosophical or spreading too much
    psycho-babble, you need an anchor - something that keeps you in touch with
    the ground, reality. Otherwise everything gets warped out of perspective.
    And in our profession, sys admins as a class tend to be the obsessive I'm-not-going-to-quit-until-I've-licked-this-problem
    type. I'm not claiming that a hobby will make you into the <TT>net.god</TT>,
    but I strongly believe that it is an enabling characteristic. </DD>
