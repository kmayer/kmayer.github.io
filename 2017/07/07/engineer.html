<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">My job is to be the dumbest person in the room; I want to work with intelligent, opinionated people who can make the world a little better. Then iterate.</code></p>

<p>I’m the CTO of <a href="https://www.pacerpro.com">PacerPro</a>. If you’re looking for a software developer job, read on, my friend. If you’re not looking, yet, now, or never, but you know of someone who might be interested in this, please pass this on to them. You never know how things work out.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">What is PacerPro and why should I care?</span>  PacerPro solves a terrible productivity problem with the US Courts system. PacerPro searches for, and collects documents from, PACER.gov<label for="pacer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="pacer" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER_(law)">PACER</a> (acronym for Public Access to Court Electronic Records) is an electronic public access service of United States federal court documents. It looks like it was written using 1990s era FrontPage. It has <a href="https://free.law/2015/03/20/what-is-the-pacer-problem/">lots of problems</a>. Most of the documents from PACER are behind a “paywall,” even though they are public records, but once they are downloaded from PACER, we can distribute them without charge. </span>, then distributes them to our clients. We strive to have the most accurate, up-to-date, and complete set of “facts on the ground.” The company has been in business since 2012; we have paying customers, many of them in the <a href="http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784597030/The-2017-Am-Law-100?slreturn=20170607151359">Am Law 100</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-mcgrane-a9baa82/">Gavin McGrane</a> is a very straightforward CEO, no drama.<label for="my-start" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="my-start" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I’ve been involved with PacerPro since 2013 when I was anchoring the project at Pivotal Labs. </span> He knows the business because he (and his family) are lawyers. The company has an interesting, albeit work-a-day, future. Our mission is to make PACER documents more accessible, with less friction and lower costs. If you’ve heard of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/the-inside-story-of-aaron-swartzs-campaign-to-liberate-court-filings/2/">Aaron Swartz</a>’s efforts or the <a href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP</a> project, we’re in a similar space, except that we’re trying to do it in a way that is financially profitable (in the long run, anyway, that’s the plan).</p>

<p><label for="jaguar-priest" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="jaguar-priest" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/jaguar-priest.jpg" /><br />WANTED: Jaguar Priest<br />To impersonate and invoke the deity<br />To offer food and drink to the idols<br />To effect the drawing of the pebbles and regulate the calendar<br />To read weather and other omens in the clouds<br />To study the night sky and interpret the appearance of the celestial bodies<br />To determine the lucky and unlucky days for various mundane activities by the casting of lots<br />To perform the numerous rituals of the cup, plate, etc.<br />To work miracles<br />To concoct medicinal herbs into ceremonial drinks<br />To predict the future<br />To announce the times for various agricultural and other activities<br />To insure adequate rainfall<br />To avert or bring to a timely end famine, drought, epidemics, plagues of ants and locusts, earthquakes<br />To distribute food to the hungry in time of need<br />To cut the honey from the hives<br />To determine the compensation to be placed on the crossroad altars<br />To read from the sacred scriptures the future road of the katun [calendar round]<br />To design and supervise the carving of stelae [stone monuments], the manufacture of word and clay idols, and the construction of temples<br />To construct tables of eclipses and heliacal risings of planets [such as are found in the Dresden Codex]<br />–Makemson, M.W. <em>The Book of the Jaguar Priest</em>, a translation of the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin, with commentary. Henry Schuman, New York, 1951, p. 141.</span>I’m looking for my next “senior” engineer. (I’d like to hire a <em>pair</em>, but, you know, budget.) <span class="newthought">What makes for an interesting candidate?</span>  It’s not a degree or <em>n</em> years of experience. PacerPro’s founders are practicing lawyers. They know their stuff. I probably have the fewest number of degrees compared to everyone else in the company. When I talk about “senior,” I’m looking for someone who can <em>lead</em> when it comes to pairing and test-driving (if you don’t know what these are, you’re not what I’m looking for).</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want to work using our methodologies. We are an Agile shop in a mostly XP style; we have a daily stand-up (and evening round-up), pair-programming is our default stance; we need a good reason <em>not</em> to pair. Test-Driven-Development is how we grow code. Clear, understandable code is more valuable than clever tricks. We do code reviews on pull requests. We pass the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">“Joel Test.”</a></li>
  <li>You understand our business, or, if you don’t, you have a genuine curiosity and ability to learn it. You can have conversations with our customers and stakeholders.</li>
  <li>You know how to research a problem. You know when to ask for help.</li>
  <li>You are an eternal student and teacher. You want to bring us all to the next level, as do we for you. I’m not expecting you to be an <em>expert</em> in <em>everything</em>, but competence or the ability to spin up without too much inertia is a requirement.</li>
  <li>You can think beyond the current story and consider ROI.</li>
  <li>You’ve shipped a <em>real</em> product before that you can show me.</li>
  <li>You have <em>hands-on</em> experience with our technology stack. I hear that “full stack” has become a dirty word, but we all do pretty much everything around here. Our web server is written in Ruby on Rails 4.2.x, with a smidgen of Node Express. Our front end is mostly written in ReactJS 0.14, our newer code uses Redux, with a bunch of legacy Backbone code. Yep, we got ourselves some technical debt. We know where it is (mostly) and how to fix it, given time and eyeballs.</li>
  <li>Expect to handle Zendesk tickets from lawyers about one day out of the week.</li>
</ul>

We’re pretty good at handling them, too, which is another good thing. Our PostgreSQL database has grown to about 200GB; the S3 store has approximately 2 million documents; and, at peak, we get 500-750 requests per minute. We send out 500,000 transactional emails per month.</p>

<p>PacerPro is a small, distributed team. There is no physical office (at the time of this writing; we have tentative plans, fall 2017, to establish a space near the CalTrain station at 4th &amp; King). We live in an always-on virtual space of <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethmayer/status/862728339928129536">SoCoCo</a> and Screenhero. If you need <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethmayer/status/854164081481089026">something</a> to be <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethmayer/status/852953207856799745">productive</a>, we’ll reimburse you for it. Because we pair a lot, we have to work during a common, scheduled, time slot, 9:30-5:30, Pacific Time. I’ll do my best to accommodate some time shifting. Since pairing is as intense as it is productive, we work a reasonable work day. After hours and weekends are the rare exceptions, only when it can’t be avoided.</p>

<p>Interested? Reach out to me jaguar-priest@pacerpro.com</p>

<p>Still confused about the <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/jaguar.html">Jaguar Priest</a>?</p>
