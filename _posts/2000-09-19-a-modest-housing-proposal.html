<p>I've been thinking about the next logical step in Silicon Valley human
  resource management. Already there are campuses where you never have to
  leave for (almost) all of your personal needs: the dry-cleaner will pick
  up and deliver; cafeterias, webvan.com and take-out-taxi/ meals on wheels
  keep you fed; health clubs, masseuse and the roving chiropractor keep your
  body functional; showers and locker rooms keep personal hygiene up to
  acceptable standards. So what's next in this reinvention of the company
  town?

<p>I'll bet you're going to say housing.

<p>I think that the Tokyo style <a
  href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~gordon/stories/capsule.html">
  capsule hotels</a> could make it really big in the high rent, always
  looking for young meat, market of Silicon Valley.  Cisco should really
  look into this. For those of you who have never heard of these things,
  imagine a box open on one end just big enough for you to sleep
  in. They have just a few amenities like TV, alarm clock, maybe a
  telephone. Pure function in the minimum amount of volume.

<p>Think about it: rents around here are ridiculous, $1,200 for a 1BR
  postage stamp. A recent <a
    href="http://www.bayinsider.com/news/1999/12/09/housing.html">study</a>
  showed that new housing construction permits are <em>down</em> from last
  year and that there is one new residence built for ever 3.something jobs
  created. Kids fresh out of college are getting paid really big bucks just
  so they can afford the cost of living here. Of course, once the company
  IPOs, 1 in 10 like to buy the $1million spread. Even so, you're pretty
  lucky if you don't have an hour commute. In this era of trying to crank
  ever more hours out of a person, personal "life" be damned, this is the
  holy grail. Just add one of these 1,000 unit homages to mass production to
  your corporate campus, charge a nominal rent and get access to your
  "resource" 24x7. Offer some nice "dormitory" like features, so the kids
  will feel like they never left college - why else call the place a
  "campus" - such as communal kitchens and TV lounges, add some upscale
  additions like maid service and maybe a bar and they will never have to
  leave! Since the companies can charge rent, the place even pays for itself
  after, okay let's be generous, ten years. It's not even a cost center!

<p>I'm not even sure this is a <em>bad</em> thing. Getting highly
  paid, yet single, and unattached people out of dwellings that could
  easily accommodate a large extended family of minimum-wage recent
  immigrants would alleviate the shortage of housing for those underpaid
  unskilled workers needed to keep all of the beemers, boxters and
  roadsters shiny, not to mention the lattes hot and bathrooms
  clean. The major problem in the Valley won't be a housing shortage for
  the highly paid nerd who can afford to win a bidding war against
  someone making minimum wage at McDonald's; It will be the shortage of
  low cost labor that keeps the physical infrastructure from crumbling
  down around us.

<p>The next question will be: How many OC-3's will you need to satisfy the
  Internet jones of a thousand lonely engineers?
