    <P>It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since we left the
      house in Los Gatos and moved aboard the S/V <EM>Wishful Thinking.</EM>
      We made trips to Angel Island, South Beach Harbor, Richmond Marina,
      Pier 39, Vallejo YC, Golden Gate YC... covering something over 800
      miles this year.</P>

    <h4>Christmas 1997</h4>

    <p>Our Christmas vacation last year was a whirlwind tour of Ken's old
      haunts on the East Coast from Washington, D.C. to Newport, RI. As an
      added bonus, we took Ananke with us. For a cat that has never really
      travelled before, she did very well! We spent several days with Ken's
      family celebrating Christmas and Hannukah. There were also stops to
      visit friends in Philadelphia and Virginia. New Year's Eve was at Paul
      &amp; Jana's for a marathon Cosmic Encounter game (newcomer Suzy won),
      followed by champagne and sleep.</p>

    <h4>January 1998</h4>

    <p>We started the year with the arrival of all of the parts to repair
      the engine, including the new exhaust manifold. Unfortunately, it
      would be a few more weeks before the mechanic could schedule us for
      the installation. Meanwhile we kept busy staying warm. At the end of
      the month, we went over to Oakland for the Pineapple Sails anniversary
      party, where we met a few friends (old and new), including several
      people who might need crew for their racing boats.

    <h4>February</h4>
    <img src="/assets/img/diag/cover2.jpg" ALT="cover2.jpg" align=right>
    <p>Suzy and I have our birthdays only 5 days apart, so February is our
      birthday <em>month</em>. February also brought torrential rains and
      flooding to much of Northern California. This was not the first time
      that living on a boat had a significant advantage over living on land
      (or mud), but it was certainly graphic. Being hardy souls, we didn't
      think it was too much trouble to travel up the Sacramento to buy a
      used RIB. The seller, and now friend, Jack Chalais, was very nice, and
      when the wind howled and the rain soaked us (even before the car
      refused start), he kindly offered to drive the dink down to Redwood
      City instead of watching us struggling with the beast on top of my
      sporty, but tiny Toyota Celica.

    <h4>March</h4>

    <p>At the end of the month we were at Berkeley Yacht Club for a swap
      meet. There we meet Ed Shirk who, as it just so happened, was looking
      to swap slips with someone in Redwood City for a few weeks. We spent 3
      weeks "sampling" the marina. We loved it there; so much so that we
      strongly considered relocating permanently. But after three weeks of a
      killer commute, we decided that it was not a good idea. On the other
      hand, we had such a good time at BYC that we joined the club. By the
      time we were "initiated" into the club, most members thought we were
      old timers!</P>

    <P>The Berkeley Marina has an easy entrance that allows us to enter and
      dock in the wee hours of the morning if we choose to make a Friday night
      passage.  It's a 4 to 6 hour sail from the South Bay depending on the ebb &
      flow.  That means if we want to participate in any Saturday event, then we
      better already be there when the sun comes up! </P>

    <h4>April</h4>

    <p>In April, SSS had their hands-on seminar at Richmond Yacht Club. We
      were curious as to how the single-handers did things (since its just
      one less than double-handing, like us!) and Suzy had some cruising
      experience to share. The approach into the slip was a bit exciting;
      even though the wind was flat most of the day, it started to blow on
      the beam just as we made our way into the fairways. It took a bit of
      to'ing and fro'ing but we made it in without banging things up. This
      trip is also where we learned how to turn a rock-climbing harness into
      a mast climbing rig that doesn't require someone on deck to haul you
      up. </p>

    <img src="/assets/img/photo/renaming.jpg" ALT="renaming.jpg" align=right></a>
    <p>On April 26 we (finally) had the appropriate renaming ceremony for
      the boat. First we had to remove the old name, then we had to have the
      de-naming ceremony, then we had to wait for dry, warm weather to put on
      the new name. Well, you can see how it could take awhile. Anyway, the
      party was quite enjoyable. There was much food, beer, champagne and
      rejoicing. Oh, and Ken proposed to Suzy and she said <em>yes!</em>

    <h4>May</h4>

    <p>May was a whirlwind! We took a trip to Pier 39 when Ken's parents
      were visiting -- they stayed in a pretty B&amp;B on Russian
      Hill. Ellen Chang came to visit and we took her along with a bunch of friends
      on a tour of the Bay. Finally, at the end of the month, KFOG held a Sky
      Concert just south of the Bay Bridge. We took Bill and Lynn along for
      the ride from Redwood, met Joy and Mark at Clipper Cove and had a
      wonderful time. This was also our debut CyberCruise. We gave everyone
      a good show Sunday morning when we snagged the "infamous" Clipper Cove
      cable with our anchor.

    <h4>June</h4>

    <p>In June, FreeGate had their annual picnic, this year on Angel
      Island. Chuck Price and I decided that driving to Tiburon, then taking
      the ferry over was tres cliche compared with <em>sailing</em>
      there. (Of course Chuck keeps his boat in Ballena Bay, while we still
      lived in Redwood City at the time.) We got a bit of a late start and
      didn't arrive until after sunset, but Chuck picked a good mooring and
      we just rafted up. The next day was a mix of sleeping late, watching
      the SSS TransPac race start, then renting bikes on the island and then
      nibbling pate, wine and cheese on deck. </p>

    <h4>July</h4><img src="/assets/img/photo/dinghy-race.jpg" ALT="dinghy-race.jpg" align=right>
<P>A July 4th "cruise in" took us to Bethel Island in
    The Delta.  Now, that's a long trip even for a long weekend - 16 hrs
    each way.
  </P>

    <P>One of the best parts of all this is the new friends we've made.   Now,
      when we go to a new marina or gathering of most any kind, we run into
      boating friends.  I think Ken just shook his head in the beginning.  I
      couldn't go anywhere without being recognized by an old cruising friend or
      simply someone who knew me from the pages of Latitude 38.  Today, we are
      both a presence.  Folks recognize <EM>Wishful Thinking.</EM>  Ken gets
      wonderful complements on both the vessel and his handling of our website.
      He's been in print himself with a piece in Latitude 38 on YOTREPS, the
      Pacific Seafarers Net cruiser tracking site which he "hacked" to
      automatically update.  Remember, it isn't what or who you know, it's who
      knows you.</P>

    <h4>August</h4>

    <img src="/assets/img/photo2/crossing.jpg" ALT="crossing.jpg" align=left>
    <p>July & August were spent with delivery preparations
    and the passages from Hawaii back to San Francisco on Compass
    Rose. Ken spent most of the 26 days glued to the radio.  (Suzy wrote a
    whole <a href="/ug/ifonly.html">piece</a> on the subject.)

    <img src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0008.JPG" ALT="IMG0008.JPG" align=right valign=bottom>
    <p>The cat, Ananke, had her share of
    medical issues to deal with this year.  First, in the winter, she had
    a benign tumor in her thyroid that needed treatment via radioactive
    iodine. Then, over the summer, we nearly lost her after a problem with
    the administering of an anesthetic while she was getting an x-ray for
    an unrelated soft-tissue injury. We think she may have nicked her
    trachea during the procedure so she started leaking air under her
    skin. It blew her up like a balloon, hence her <em>new</em> nickname
    "Blimpo the Cat." The vets took very good care of her (she became
    somewhat of a celebrity for the size and extent of the "emphysema")
    during her convalescence and we made the visit down to South San Jose
    almost every day to check on her progress. It was pretty scary for
    awhile, but after a few weeks we got her back, with a slightly punk
    fur-do where they had to shave her.

    <h4>October</h4>

    <p>We took a trip to Treasure Island for Fleet Week. Although we had
      planned on sailing into the Bay to watch the ships and jets go by, TI
      was the perfect observation point, so we never left the dock. We
      crashed a wedding, drank some wine, and on our way home, got buzzed by
      an F-14 on a low fly-over.</p>

    <h4>November</h4>

    <img src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0069.JPG" ALT="IMG0069.JPG" align=right>
    <P>We were aboard the "Blackbeard's" 65 foot live-aboard dive charter boat
      that took us from Miami to the waters around Bimini for a full week. It was
      chock full of adventures including a shark dive, a hurricane (Mitch) and a
      shipwreck!

    <P>We never quite managed the camping trip we talked about in August or the
      visit to Calistoga Springs, but they're still on our list (as is the Kayak
      trip to Tomales Bay ;-).</P>

    <h4>December, 1998</h4>

    <p><EM>Wishful Thinking</EM> is all decked out with Christmas lights and this
      year we also have a nice Christmas Tree.  We've placed the strands of
      lights so that they can remain up while we're sailing! It's extremely cold
      here (considering this is supposed to be California) with three separate
      occasions of hard freezes with ice on the docks.  It must be time to go
      south...</P>

    <P>Things seemed to have gotten worse at the Peninsula Marina by the time
      we returned and we were again motivated to move to a marina in Alameda
      despite the commute.  Just yesterday, our "number came up" and we got a
      fine slip in Marina Village.  We'll be moving between Christmas and New
      Years... right after we recover from a special party being thrown for a
      friend on the 27th at Berkeley Yacht Club.  </p>

    <h4>January</h4>

    <P>Ken will be telecommuting part of the time and that will help with
      commute stress, but the best parts of the move are the close proximity to
      good sailing and the pleasant marina atmosphere.  We'll be docked right next
      to Oakland Yacht Club and Encinal Yacht Club.  The supermarket and other
      shopping is nearby and there are wonderful paths for walking, biking, and
      roller-blading.  We can take a $5 water taxi ride to Jack London Square and
      any number of other places.  The Ferry is one of the commute options and
      there's a fine little Blues Bar just down the street.   I suspect the thing
      we'll miss about the marina in Redwood City is it's nearby 12 Cinema
      Complex.  I'll bet we've seen 15 first run movies this year and that's got
      to be a record. </P>

    <P>We've decided to put most of my stories, recipes, and advice into a
      WebBook.  While it will be a work in progress for a good while,  it's
      taking shape more & more each day.  It's a labor of love.  There'll be lots
      of related pictures too.  You'll have to ask Ken about the "pleasures"
      associated with Adobe Photo Shop!</P>

    <P>Time is moving very <em>very</em> quickly.  It's almost scary when you
      realize that our "cruise date" is considerably less than 2 years away!</P>

    <p>Merry Christmas / Happy Hanaka, and Happy New Year!!!</p>

    <B>Ken & Suzy & Ananke</B>
