    <p>Pictures? We got <em><a

    <p>My "dirt dwelling" friends thought that this was a great weekend. Suzy and
      I did too!

    <p>First after consulting the tide tables, we discovered that low tide was at
      11:15 instead of 9:15 (oops, wrong weekend). So, it was either move on out
      at 8:00 in the way-too-early-am or wait until the bathtub started to fill
      again. I made an executive decision to sleep in. A well rested crew is a
      happy crew. Bill and Lynn arrived at about 1:00, just in time; we had just
      finished putting the awning away and started the engine. Suzy was below
      roasting the garlic for later. After an aborted attempt at the pump out,
      we made our way to the marina entrance. The dreaded Peninsula Marina
      entrance. After digging a few clams out of the sand bar, we pushed our way
      out of the creek.

    <p>Our guests brought sandwiches and wine (yummm) for a late lunch while we
      motored in the noser-lies. We finally got the sails up at Coyote Point.
      Hey, we're cruisers. The ride wasn't too comfortable with full sails so we
      put a reef in the main, then tried to monkey with our 140 Genoa. The top
      swivel is uncooperative so we ended up just furling the thing and raising
      the staysail. I'm quite happy to make 6 knots without sailing on our ear,
      thank you!

    <p>Not too much traffic on the way up. And we arrived at TI more or
      less on time. Now, here we are, complete newbies to the way of <a
        href="http://cybercruise.microtech.com">CyberCruising</a>. My last
      raft up was, well, let's just say a looong time ago. And we'd never
      been to Clipper Cove either! Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and we
      were getting hungry. Thank you Thank you Thank you <a href="http://cybercruise.microtech.com/dragonlady.html">Dragon Lady</a> for the
      use of your dink.

    <p>We had just barely settled in when <a
      href="http://cybercruise.microtech.com/adriana.html">La Adriana</a>
      swooped in to hails and cheers. The next thing I knew, we were being
      boarded! In another moment, Adriana was gone with her new
      passengers. <a
        href="http://cybercruise.microtech.com/stubalu.html">Stu</a> wanted to
      go, and his boat became the "kids boat" as 9 of the chronologically
      challenged hopped on.  Instead of playing raft-up ballet, I just
      thought it would be easier to pull my hook and take my guests around
      on Wishful Thinking. (Ominous music starts to play in the background)
      The anchor came up just fine (And the music builds in volume).

    <p>Stereo blasting, anchor down just south of YB, the <a
      href="http://www.hooked.net/users/mdboblet/P16.jpg">fireworks</a> were
      awesome.  There were lots of oos and aahs. The other boats that were
      closer in were silhouetted against the flares and rockets. Ahhh. Just
      a minute to let it all sink in. Then, hey look at all those boats
      heading our way.  And look, there's The Spirit of San Francisco
      heading straight for us! Agggh!  Engines!  Anchor up! And a happy
      little motor back to the cove.

    <p>We dropped the hook again (there's that music ...) and boy it set right
      away, didn't it? Aren't these Bruce anchors great or what? (da dum ... da
      dum)  Now, it is what, 10:30? Time for dinner! Roasted garlic with brie --
      next time we'll have more to share -- if you missed out.  Brownies from
      Tom -- life is so uncertain, eat dessert first. Homebrew beer, steak,
      baked potatoes and ice cream. yummm-mm. A quick trip with Joy & Mark back
      to the dock so they can drive home, and everyone is finally racked out by
      1am.

    <p>The next morning started with (freshly ground) coffee and cinnamon buns.
      We got an invite from a friend to go have lunch at a Thai Temple in
      Berkeley -- awesome food, they set up behind the temple and you get papaya
      salad, Pad Thai, sticky rice and mangoes. Ah!  (food is a major theme,
      yes?)  But first we had to get there, so...

    <p>On goes the engine, up goes the anchor chain and <a
      href="http://www.hooked.net/users/mdboblet/P23.jpg">whoops</a>! We
      picked up a cable. A BIG cable. <a
        href="http://www.hooked.net/users/mdboblet/P24.jpg"><em>three really
        big cables</em></a>. There was much tugging and pulling and hauling
      and grunting -- who was playing <a
        href="http://www.hooked.net/users/mdboblet/P25.jpg">Ride of the
        Valkyries</a> in the background? I kept looking over my shoulder for
      the Hueys. Finally, with Stu's help (we owe you some homebrew!), the
      anchor was <a
        href="http://www.hooked.net/users/mdboblet/P27.jpg">strongly
        encouraged to let go</a>.

    <p>The trip to Berkeley was fine (did anyone else notice all of those boats
      out there, fishing?) Lunch was plentiful and good. By 2:30, the wind was
      up, we sailed reefed all the to San Bruno.

    <p>Coming into the slough, Bill offered to make his famous Mango Margaritas.
      Being a full service cruising boat, we pulled out the blender and fired up
      the inverter. By the time we were entering the marina, Bill was ready to
      pour. (Stu just shook his head and said something unintelligible -- well
      Suzy said I didn't want to know ;-)

    <p>Ahh. What a great day. The sunset was beautiful purple and magenta. What a
      great weekend.
