<h2>Quiz time!</h2>

<ol>
<li>How many times (each day) have you typed this at your console?<br />
<code>git push heroku master</code> and then <em>forgotten</em> to run<br />
<code>heroku run rake db:migrate --app yellow-snow-3141</code> <em>or</em><br />
<code>heroku ps:restart</code></li>
<li>Does your script support a multi-stage environments?</li>
<li>Do you remember how to get to the application's console process?</li>
<li>Is your application's configuration <em>consistent</em> across all stages?</li>
<li>Are you deploy scripts <em>tested</em>?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Yeah, me too.</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://github.com/fastestforward/heroku_san"><code>heroku_san</code></a>, the 85% solution, which allows me to do this:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ rake staging deploy
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And this is what happens: Maintenance mode is turned on; the latest green build is deployed to my staging server; all pending migrations are run, the app restarted, and then maintenance mode disabled. All while I go get a fresh cup of joe.</p>

<p>The value for us is that we don't repeat ourselves, that our app will deploy, and we are confident that extending the toolkit is easy with a clear API and good test coverage. That's a big win when you have dozens of apps deploying all day long.</p>

<p>Installation is pretty simple; add <code>gem 'heroku_san'</code> to your <code>Gemfile</code> (you <em>are</em> using Bundler, aren't you?). This gem is only used locally, so you can add it to your <code>group :development, :test</code> block. Then create and edit a configuration file; <code>config/heroku.yml</code>[1]. The README file has more details and there's a <a href="http://github.com/fastestforward/heroku_san/wiki">wiki</a> on github with handy tips on how to extend the basic functionality in common ways.</p>

<h2>So, why?</h2>

<p>The gem has been around since 2010 and supported by a loyal core of maintainers. Version 2.1.1 brings <a href="http://github.com/fastestforward/heroku_san/compare/v1.3.0...v2.1.1">changes large and small</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest change since v1.3 is the creation of 2 new classes: Project and Stage, and a test suite to drive out the features. The task library is now almost entirely simple method calls, so there's a lot of confidence that they will run correctly. Just to make sure, however, I've written an integration test, <a href="http://github.com/fastestforward/heroku_san/blob/ffe43224bc65479e46a3a02891f6ef17357b30e2/features/remote.feature"><code>remote.feature</code></a> which exercises the whole stack by creating an app on Heroku and run it through its paces. It's worth a read.</p>

<p>There are some other new features worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroku stack support (aspen, bamboo and cedar)</li>
<li>Direct use of the Heroku::Client (instead of calls out to the shell)</li>
<li>tags -- By adding an (optional) tag configuration value to your <code>heroku.yml</code> file, <code>heroku_san</code> will deploy only the most recent revision with that tag to your stage. This is great for creating a multi-stage environment, and when combined with <a href="http://github.com/zilkey/auto_tagger">auto_tagger</a> and a continuous integration server (CI), you get a lot of bang for a little bit. See the <a href="http://github.com/fastestforward/heroku_san/wiki/Using-Autotagger">wiki</a> for more complete instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>Why write your own deploy scripts, again. Use <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/heroku_san"><code>heroku_san</code></a> (or another gem like <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/kumade"><code>kumade</code></a>)</p>
