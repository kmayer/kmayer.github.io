<p><a title="Timecop gem on github" href="https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop">Timecop</a> is a great additionÂ to your testing toolbox, but if you've ever tried to use Timecop to interact with a database, and then got the most mysterious of existential errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><span style="color:red;">expected: Sun, 08 Jun 2014 19:18:22 UTC +00:00
     got: Sun, 08 Jun 2014 19:18:22 UTC +00:00</span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel your pain.</p>
<p>The trouble comes from the fact that Timecop is freezing time at the resolution of the native Time class, which on my Mac OS X machine is microseconds (aka "usec"), but the database, in this case MySQL only records time to the second. RSpec is trying to be helpful with its matchers by calling <code>#to_s</code>, but that hides the significant, sub-second difference.</p>
<p>Here's a quick little monkey patch that I added to my spec support:</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">class Timecop
  def self.database_compatible_time(now = Time.zone.now)
    now.change(usec: 0)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>This uses a Rails helper to reset the microsecond portion of the time object. So, instead of</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">now = Time.zone.now

Timecop.freeze(now) do
  ...
end
</pre>
<p>I do this:</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">now = Timecop.database_compatible_time

Timecop.freeze(now) do
  ...
end
</pre>
<p>And no more head scratching. It's sort of database specific, so your mileage may vary.</p>
