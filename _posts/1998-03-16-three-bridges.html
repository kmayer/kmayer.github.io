    <p>Berkeley Yacht Club, California, US<br>

    <p>No, I'm not referring to Lloyd, Bo, and Jeff.  Three Bridges is one
      of the claims to fame of the Berkeley Marina in Berkeley, CA.  From
      the <a href="http://www.berkeleyyc.org/">Yacht Club</a>, the
      appropriately placed benches, the Berkeley Pier, and Skates restaurant
      one can see the Golden Gate, The Bay Bridge, and The Richmond
      Bridge... not to mention spectacular sunsets!  There's also a grand
      view of The City.

    <p>Ken &amp; I are here with Wishful Thinking to meet some of the
      Berkeley Yacht Club folks and decide if we'd like to apply for
      membership.  Of course, they get the opportunity to decide if they
      want us as members as well :-) We made an arrangement with a new
      friend of ours to swap slips for a couple of weeks.  He wants to get a
      jump start on his new job just a few blocks from Peninsula Marina in
      Redwood, and we want to see what the commute is like to Sunnyvale from
      THIS side of the bay.  A lot loooooonger, we know, but much closer to
      sailing so it may be worth the extra drive.  Only a few weeks of
      commuting and the odd midnight sail will tell.

      Yesterday, we sailed (uh, motor sailed) against noserlies because of the
      Hi/Low tide timing at each end of our journey.  The furler mechanism
      decided to be obstinate, so all we had up was the main.  That made it a bit
      wet & splashy and we now know that
      Ananke (the cat) will <em>not</em> use her
      litterbox when we lash it on the stern deck!   She thought Ken's backpack
      and his gently-worn pair of Levis served as a fine substitute litter box
      though.  Ooooops.

    <p>We also discovered a leak on the port side at the mid-ships stanchion.  It
      didn't leak during all that rain... go figure!

    <p>Ken is off at his Advanced Navigation Class this evening, and after a day
      of misc clean-up and minor repairs, I indulged myself with a long hot dock
      shower and a glass of Zin on the bench at sunset.  Mmmmmmm!

    <p>I can't wait for Ken to get <em>home</em>.

    <p>Suzy
