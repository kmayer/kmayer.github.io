      <h1>The Elevator Speech</h1>
<p class="subtitle">February 24, 2007</p>

<p>The purpose of the "speech" is to condense the project definition
into something that would fit into the time it takes to ride an
elevator. This is where all good ideas are pitched, apparently; you
stalk an unwary VC until he or she is trapped inside the elevator has
no choice but to listen to your prattling. If your idea has any merit,
pray that the VC doesn't call on someone else to launch the project
and leave you out in the cold.

<dl>
<dt>FOR
<dd>the target user or customer
<dt>WHO
<dd>a state of the need or opportunity
<dt>THE
<dd>name of your system
<dt>IS A
<dd>kind of system it is
<dt>THAT
<dd>statement of the key benefit - the compelling reason to use it
<dt>UNLIKE
<dd>the primary competitive alternative
<dt>OUR SYSTEM
<dd>a statement of the primary differentiation
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Digging deeper</h2>

<p>Something else from the ArsDigita world, a questionnaire to help
organize the project.

<dl>

<dt>Title

<dt>List the class of users

<dd>The classes of user that you expect to be connecting to this Web
service.  In a community site for American owners of Honda cars, the
anticipated user classes would be (1) Honda owners, (2) Honda dealers,
and (3) employees of American Honda.

<dt>Say what they will be able to do

<dd>
Remember that 
<ul>
<li>      Nobody cares or will remember how the site looks 
<li>      Nobody cares or will remember how the bboard flows 
<li>      Nobody cares or will remember how the chat system works 
<li>      Nobody cares or will remember how registration works 
<li>      People will remember one thing: I went to the site to
          accomplish Task X and I accomplished it. 
</ul>

For each class of user that you identified above, please list the
significant new capabilities that
those users will have in virtue of our having built this site: 
See <a
href="http://intranet.arsdigita.com/proposals/significant-new-capabilities-example.adp">this
example of what we'd write for the Honda owners service</a>

<dt>Set forth a comprehensive feature list

<dd>If you have a laundry list of features that you want that aren't
especially innovative but would be nice to have, include them here in
a complete list of desired site features. Note that this may contain
for the Honda site, we'd tack on stuff like affinity email addresses,
so that a person could be "JoeAccordOwner@hondaowners.com" and pick up
mail via a Web interface.

<dt>Say what is most valuable and why

<dd>For each important feature above, say what is valuable about the
feature to the users, to the service operator (i.e., you) and why. Try
to list the features in order of most valuable first.

<dt>Identify Dependencies

<dd>If your Web service requires getting data from another company or
computer system, say something about that.  For the Honda service that
we've sketched above, we won't be able to launch unless we get
cooperation from the folks who run the company's mainframe systems.

<dt>Minimum Launchable Feature Set

<dd>Any Web service tends to develop gradually over the years as the
publisher and the users develop better ideas.  Programmers can't work
at infinite speed.  So it is best to view the ultimate service
development as a continuous process.  Decide in advance what the
minimum launchable feature set is and then everyone will have a
target. For the Honda service that we've sketched above, the minimum
launchable feature set might be "email service reminders for owners;
owner can log in and see service history; owner can book an
appointment for additional service; dealer gets email or FAX alerts of
booked appointments."

<dt>Promotion

<dd>It doesn't matter how good the site is if nobody uses it.  What's
your plan for reaching users?  Have you raised money?  Gotten powerful
partners to agree to promote the site?  Are you relying on word of
mouth?  Something like "American Honda already has the Snail Mail
address of every vehicle owner and has budgeted to mail a four-color
flyer to every owner in the US.  In addition we'll promote the URL in
posters to be displayed in dealer service departments."
