    <p>Home port, Peninsula Marina, Redwood City, US<br>
      <a href="http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapsurfer?infact=2&outfact=2&act=place&tlevel=-&tvar=-&tmeth=i&mlat=&mlon=&msym=redpin&mlabel=Peninsula+Marina&murl=&lat=37.5044022&lon=-122.2129211&wid=0.090&ht=0.033&conf=mapnew.con&map.x=178&map.y=211">37N29.55' 122W15.98'</a>

    <p>(Most) people aren't very creative when it comes to imagining life on a boat;
      "Isn't it wet?" "Aren't you cold?" "It's so small, how can you stand it."
      That is like asking a bird if it minds its feathers or a fish its scales.
      If you choose to live on water, these are not the things you think about.
      First, the boat, my boat, is warm, dry and just the right size for Suzy and
      I. I wouldn't have it any other way. Heck, even the <em>cat</em> likes boat
      living! (That was an unexpected, but pleasant surprise.) It is quite
      liberating not to have to deal with all the extra stuff that accumulates
      with a life on land. It is a cleansing feeling to get rid of all that
      <em>junk</em> that I had just lying about. Anything I bring with me on the
      boat is something I truly want, need, and probably both. I do not want for
      anything important. (This is not to say that I have everything; a nice long
      hot shower has become one of life's luxuries. Then again, when was the last
      time you felt soooo good about a simple thing like a hot shower?)

    <p><img src="/assets/img/photo/sunset.jpg" align=RIGHT alt="Sunset at the marina">
      Then there are the things that I didn't even consider before. Living at
      the edge of the sea, you live at the interface between all things: wet and
      dry, light and dark, death and life. We live at the edge of Bair Island,
      one of the most important wetland areas in San Francisco. I get to see more
      aquatic life right outside my window, er, porthole, than most get to see on
      a nature walk. From the mundane ducks and seagulls to wading birds, cranes,
      fishing birds, there is even a harbor seal that hunts in the marina from
      time to time. There seems to be nothing more peaceful than to sit in the
      cockpit with my coffee and watch the birds fly, fish, preen and paddle.

    <p><em>Wishful Thinking</em> is becoming the fourth member of the family.
      She shelters us, sustains us, and rocks us to sleep at night. Like
      another person, I'm discovering that she breathes and stretches. She has
      wings! She also pisses and farts like the rest of us ;-) I am becoming
      familiar with her ryhtms as much as I am with Suzy's. We know when something
      is &quot;off&quot;. And like any other mature member, her aches and pains
      sometime take longer to heal than in her younger days.

    <p>&quot;Have you taken her sailing yet?&quot; is a very common question.
      Unfortunately, the answer is still no. We were going to go for a sail a few
      weeks ago, honestly, we were. We got up bright and early one Sunday
      morning, the weather looked perfect for our first sail since we bought her.
      Steady, but light winds, partly cloudy skies. We packed up, made coffee,
      even got the cat ready for <em>her</em> first excursion. It was Suzy's turn
      to drive. We motored over to the pump out station; one of our usual
      activities for the weekend. We performed the ritual cleansing of the boat,
      then headed out of the marina. We got halfway to the entrance, not even
      100 yards, when the oil pressure alarm started sputtering and the oil
      pressure gauge showed a slow, steady decline toward trouble. By this time,
      we were at the entrance to the marina, with no room to turn around. Once we
      got into Redwood Creek, Suzy did a 180, and motored us back to the slip. So
      much for an excursion!

    <p>It looks like the high pressure oil feed cracked and sprayed almost all
      of the oil into the bilge. We spent the next four hours or so dealing with
      the environmental hazards. While we had everything taken apart, we managed
      to do a few more repairs, so the day wasn't a total loss, but by nightfall,
      we were spent. I think I enjoyed that evening's shower more than most.

    <p>
      So we're stuck here, dockside, for awhile, until we can get the
      replacement part for the engine. Meanwhile we've been doing other
      maintenance, and while we're all jonesing for a sail, we're not bored
      either. The rains have come to Northern California. That has presented a few
      new challenges. We're also planning our trip back east to visit my friends
      and family. I'm hoping to take the boat out at least once before the new
      year, but that may be <em>Wishful Thinking</em>.
