      <p>Happy Holidays to all of you. I apologize for not calling before it was
        too late this evening, but time zones and events overtook me.

      <p>Suzy and are doing well. We just returned the boat from a 3 week stint in
        Berkeley. We met someone who wanted to swap slips; we wanted to see what
        Bay sailing was like (our home marina in Redwood City is about a four hour
        motor sail from most of the other sailing destinations, weather, deep
        water, etc.) and he was just starting a new job and wanted to avoid the 60
        minute commute while he ramped up and got his telecommuting
        re-established. First, berthing your boat at Berkeley Marina is about the
        nicest place that I can imagine on the Bay. You are in a sheltered marina,
        with fairways wide enough to sail in, while you are literally five
        minutes from the finest sailing the Bay has to offer (which is pretty darn
        good!). Second, commuting from Berkeley to Sunnyvale is killer. The stress
        of driving to survive just about did me in. I am happy to be a 20 leisurely
        minutes from the office again.

      <p>Wishful Thinking is coming along. We've actually spent a month without a
        major repair or upgrade! This is a good thing, especially for my bank account.
        I am hoping that we've reached the peak of new homeowneritis and things will
        quiet down to a gentle boil. ;-) We actually <em>sailed</em> the boat. Imagine
        that! All this time and we've either had some kind of mechanical problem
        or the wind has been right on our nose.

      <p>You see, we didn't return directly home from Berkeley. Instead we had a
        short detour up to Richmond Marina for the weekend. The
        <a href="http://www.sfbaysss.org">Singlehanded
          Sailing Society</a> (no, it isn't for single amputees) had a hands-on, BYOB
        (bring your own boat) seminar for their biennial race to Hawaii. We're not
        going, but it is a possibility for 2000, and the stuff we're learning by
        attending is entirely applicable to our long term cruising plans. Besides,
        it is fun to meet some (admittedly hard-core, extreme) sailors. Suzy's
        cruising experience is also providing for some interesting exchange of
        ideas.

      <p>So, we camped out Sunday night, and first thing Monday morning (I had
        arranged for a much needed day off), we set off south for home. The winds
        were light, north of the Bay Bridge. So much so that we fired up the iron
        wind for about a quarter mile (after I stubbornly forced us to try to
        <em>sail</em> through the 2 knot current for 90 minutes going nowhere, okay,
        backwards). Once under the bridge, we had a close reach most of the way
        down. It was a bit cold and squally, but nothing serious and I got to use
        my foulies for their intended purpose. After leaving at around ten, we
        pulled into the slip at about 7:30 in a dead calm (my favorite docking
        weather). After dinner, I think we both were asleep before our heads hit
        the pillow.

      <p>This week has been eventful. Even though I wasn't commuting back and forth
        from Berkeley anymore, we still managed more than a few miles on the car. Tuesday
        was a crew "mixer" hosted by the local sailing rag,
        "<a href="http://www.latitude38.com">Latitude 38</a>". Uncle Jack,
        if you don't get this, you should. It is free in lots of places (yacht
        clubs, marinas and marine supply stores). Of course the mixer was in
        Oakland, so off we went back and forth across the bay. Wednesday, SSS had
        another
        seminar, this time in Oakland (right down the block from where we were the
        night before), this time on sails, repair, and sail inventories. Quite
        fun! Thursday was an almost normal day.

      <p>Almost normal. Ananke (the cat) has a benign tumor in her thyroid gland.
        It makes her hyper sometimes and messes with other parts of her
        metabolism. We've taken her to a vetinary oncologist for radioactive
        iodine therapy. It is very much like the therapy they have for people,
        except the human patients are allowed to go home the same day, while the
        pets have to stay in isolation. You can either view this as a cost saving
        measure on the part of HMO's or over-caution on the part of state health
        officials. Hard to say. In any case, we are cat-less for the next week or
        so, or until Ananke stops glowing in the dark (or more accurately, her
        poop ;-).

      <p>Well, that's all the news that's fit to print. We're off to Sausalito
        tomorrow for a swap meet. Sunday is a day off. And Monday, I'm back to my
        coastal navigation class. Next weekend we're having a re-naming party
        for the boat. The next weekend is a boat show, and the weekend
        after that Dad and Gail are due here to visit. We'll sail the boat up to
        San Francisco for the weekend (it is <em>so</em> cool to move your house
        whenever
        the mood strikes you!) so we'll be close by. May is already starting to look
        quite busy on the social calender, and June is fast approaching.

      <p>We hope you're having a happy holiday.

      <p>Next year in Jerusalem!

      <p>Love,
      <p>Ken & Suzy & Ananke
