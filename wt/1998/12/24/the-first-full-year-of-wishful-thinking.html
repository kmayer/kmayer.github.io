      <h1>The First Full Year of Wishful Thinking</h1>
<p class="subtitle">December 24, 1998</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been over a year since we left the
house in Los Gatos and moved aboard the S/V <em>Wishful Thinking.</em>
We made trips to Angel Island, South Beach Harbor, Richmond Marina,
Pier 39, Vallejo YC, Golden Gate YC… covering something over 800
miles this year.</p>

<h2 id="christmas-1997">Christmas 1997</h2>

<p>Our Christmas vacation last year was a whirlwind tour of Ken’s old
haunts on the East Coast from Washington, D.C. to Newport, RI. As an
added bonus, we took Ananke with us. For a cat that has never really
travelled before, she did very well! We spent several days with Ken’s
family celebrating Christmas and Hannukah. There were also stops to
visit friends in Philadelphia and Virginia. New Year’s Eve was at Paul
&amp; Jana’s for a marathon Cosmic Encounter game (newcomer Suzy won),
followed by champagne and sleep.</p>

<h2 id="january-1998">January 1998</h2>

<p>We started the year with the arrival of all of the parts to repair
the engine, including the new exhaust manifold. Unfortunately, it
would be a few more weeks before the mechanic could schedule us for
the installation. Meanwhile we kept busy staying warm. At the end of
the month, we went over to Oakland for the Pineapple Sails anniversary
party, where we met a few friends (old and new), including several
people who might need crew for their racing boats.</p>

<h2 id="february">February</h2>

<p><label for="cover2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="cover2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/diag/cover2.jpg" /><br /></span></p>

<p>Suzy and I have our birthdays only 5 days apart, so February is our
birthday <em>month</em>. February also brought torrential rains and
flooding to much of Northern California. This was not the first time
that living on a boat had a significant advantage over living on land
(or mud), but it was certainly graphic. Being hardy souls, we didn’t
think it was too much trouble to travel up the Sacramento to buy a
used RIB. The seller, and now friend, Jack Chalais, was very nice, and
when the wind howled and the rain soaked us (even before the car
refused start), he kindly offered to drive the dink down to Redwood
City instead of watching us struggling with the beast on top of my
sporty, but tiny Toyota Celica.</p>

<h2 id="march">March</h2>

<p>At the end of the month we were at Berkeley Yacht Club for a swap
meet. There we meet Ed Shirk who, as it just so happened, was looking
to swap slips with someone in Redwood City for a few weeks. We spent 3
weeks “sampling” the marina. We loved it there; so much so that we
strongly considered relocating permanently. But after three weeks of a
killer commute, we decided that it was not a good idea. On the other
hand, we had such a good time at BYC that we joined the club. By the
time we were “initiated” into the club, most members thought we were
old timers!</p>

<p>The Berkeley Marina has an easy entrance that allows us to enter and
dock in the wee hours of the morning if we choose to make a Friday night
passage.  It’s a 4 to 6 hour sail from the South Bay depending on the ebb &amp;
flow.  That means if we want to participate in any Saturday event, then we
better already be there when the sun comes up!</p>

<h2 id="april">April</h2>

<p>In April, SSS had their hands-on seminar at Richmond Yacht Club. We
were curious as to how the single-handers did things (since its just
one less than double-handing, like us!) and Suzy had some cruising
experience to share. The approach into the slip was a bit exciting;
even though the wind was flat most of the day, it started to blow on
the beam just as we made our way into the fairways. It took a bit of
to’ing and fro’ing but we made it in without banging things up. This
trip is also where we learned how to turn a rock-climbing harness into
a mast climbing rig that doesn’t require someone on deck to haul you
up.</p>

<p><label for="renaming" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="renaming" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/photo/renaming.jpg" /><br /></span></p>

<p>On April 26 we (finally) had the appropriate renaming ceremony for
the boat. First we had to remove the old name, then we had to have the
de-naming ceremony, then we had to wait for dry, warm weather to put on
the new name. Well, you can see how it could take awhile. Anyway, the
party was quite enjoyable. There was much food, beer, champagne and
rejoicing. Oh, and Ken proposed to Suzy and she said <em>yes!</em></p>

<h2 id="may">May</h2>

<p>May was a whirlwind! We took a trip to Pier 39 when Ken’s parents
were visiting – they stayed in a pretty B&amp;B on Russian
Hill. Ellen Chang came to visit and we took her along with a bunch of friends
on a tour of the Bay. Finally, at the end of the month, KFOG held a Sky
Concert just south of the Bay Bridge. We took Bill and Lynn along for
the ride from Redwood, met Joy and Mark at Clipper Cove and had a
wonderful time. This was also our debut CyberCruise. We gave everyone
a good show Sunday morning when we snagged the “infamous” Clipper Cove
cable with our anchor.</p>

<h2 id="june">June</h2>

<p>In June, FreeGate had their annual picnic, this year on Angel
Island. Chuck Price and I decided that driving to Tiburon, then taking
the ferry over was tres cliche compared with <em>sailing</em>
there. (Of course Chuck keeps his boat in Ballena Bay, while we still
lived in Redwood City at the time.) We got a bit of a late start and
didn’t arrive until after sunset, but Chuck picked a good mooring and
we just rafted up. The next day was a mix of sleeping late, watching
the SSS TransPac race start, then renting bikes on the island and then
nibbling pate, wine and cheese on deck.</p>

<h2 id="july">July</h2>

<p><label for="dinghy-race" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="dinghy-race" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/photo/dinghy-race.jpg" /><br /></span></p>

<p>A July 4th “cruise in” took us to Bethel Island in
The Delta.  Now, that’s a long trip even for a long weekend - 16 hrs
each way.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of all this is the new friends we’ve made.   Now,
when we go to a new marina or gathering of most any kind, we run into
boating friends.  I think Ken just shook his head in the beginning.  I
couldn’t go anywhere without being recognized by an old cruising friend or
simply someone who knew me from the pages of Latitude 38.  Today, we are
both a presence.  Folks recognize <em>Wishful Thinking.</em>  Ken gets
wonderful complements on both the vessel and his handling of our website.
He’s been in print himself with a piece in Latitude 38 on YOTREPS, the
Pacific Seafarers Net cruiser tracking site which he “hacked” to
automatically update.  Remember, it isn’t what or who you know, it’s who
knows you.</p>

<h2 id="august">August</h2>

<p>July &amp; August were spent with delivery preparations
and the passages from Hawaii back to San Francisco on Compass
Rose. Ken spent most of the 26 days glued to the radio.  (Suzy wrote a
whole <a href="/ug/ifonly.html">piece</a> on the subject.)</p>

<p><label for="img0008" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="img0008" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0008.JPG" /><br /></span></p>

<p>The cat, Ananke, had her share of
medical issues to deal with this year.  First, in the winter, she had
a benign tumor in her thyroid that needed treatment via radioactive
iodine. Then, over the summer, we nearly lost her after a problem with
the administering of an anesthetic while she was getting an x-ray for
an unrelated soft-tissue injury. We think she may have nicked her
trachea during the procedure so she started leaking air under her
skin. It blew her up like a balloon, hence her <em>new</em> nickname
“Blimpo the Cat.” The vets took very good care of her (she became
somewhat of a celebrity for the size and extent of the “emphysema”)
during her convalescence and we made the visit down to South San Jose
almost every day to check on her progress. It was pretty scary for
awhile, but after a few weeks we got her back, with a slightly punk
fur-do where they had to shave her.</p>

<h2 id="october">October</h2>

<p>We took a trip to Treasure Island for Fleet Week. Although we had
planned on sailing into the Bay to watch the ships and jets go by, TI
was the perfect observation point, so we never left the dock. We
crashed a wedding, drank some wine, and on our way home, got buzzed by
an F-14 on a low fly-over.</p>

<h2 id="november">November</h2>

<p><label for="img0069" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="img0069" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0069.JPG" /><br /></span>
We were aboard the “Blackbeard’s” 65 foot live-aboard dive charter boat
that took us from Miami to the waters around Bimini for a full week. It was
chock full of adventures including a shark dive, a hurricane (Mitch) and a
shipwreck!</p>

<p>We never quite managed the camping trip we talked about in August or the
visit to Calistoga Springs, but they’re still on our list (as is the Kayak
trip to Tomales Bay ;-).</p>

<h2 id="december-1998">December, 1998</h2>

<p><em>Wishful Thinking</em> is all decked out with Christmas lights and this
year we also have a nice Christmas Tree.  We’ve placed the strands of
lights so that they can remain up while we’re sailing! It’s extremely cold
here (considering this is supposed to be California) with three separate
occasions of hard freezes with ice on the docks.  It must be time to go
south…</p>

<p>Things seemed to have gotten worse at the Peninsula Marina by the time
we returned and we were again motivated to move to a marina in Alameda
despite the commute.  Just yesterday, our “number came up” and we got a
fine slip in Marina Village.  We’ll be moving between Christmas and New
Years… right after we recover from a special party being thrown for a
friend on the 27th at Berkeley Yacht Club.</p>

<h2 id="january">January</h2>

<p>Ken will be telecommuting part of the time and that will help with
commute stress, but the best parts of the move are the close proximity to
good sailing and the pleasant marina atmosphere.  We’ll be docked right next
to Oakland Yacht Club and Encinal Yacht Club.  The supermarket and other
shopping is nearby and there are wonderful paths for walking, biking, and
roller-blading.  We can take a $5 water taxi ride to Jack London Square and
any number of other places.  The Ferry is one of the commute options and
there’s a fine little Blues Bar just down the street.   I suspect the thing
we’ll miss about the marina in Redwood City is it’s nearby 12 Cinema
Complex.  I’ll bet we’ve seen 15 first run movies this year and that’s got
to be a record.</p>

<p>We’ve decided to put most of my stories, recipes, and advice into a
WebBook.  While it will be a work in progress for a good while,  it’s
taking shape more &amp; more each day.  It’s a labor of love.  There’ll be lots
of related pictures too.  You’ll have to ask Ken about the “pleasures”
associated with Adobe Photo Shop!</p>

<p>Time is moving very <em>very</em> quickly.  It’s almost scary when you
realize that our “cruise date” is considerably less than 2 years away!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas / Happy Hanaka, and Happy New Year!!!</p>

<p><em>Ken &amp; Suzy &amp; Ananke</em></p>
