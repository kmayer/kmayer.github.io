      <h1>The Smartest Boat in the Marina</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 10, 1998</p>

    <p><strong>Day 1</strong>: Moved in to my new digitally-maxed out Hunter 450 at last. Finally, I
      live on the Smartest Boat in the Marina. Everything's networked. The
      cable TV is connected to our phone, which is connected to my personal
      computer, which is connected to the shore-power lines, all the appliances
      and the security system. Everything runs off a universal remote with the
      friendliest interface I've ever used. Programming is a snap.

    <p>I'm like, totally wired.

    <p><strong>Day 2</strong>: Hot Stuff! Programmed my VCR from the office, turned up the
      thermostat and switched on the lights with the car phone, remotely
      tweaked the oven a few degrees for my pizza. Everything nice &amp; cozy when
      I arrived. Maybe I should get the universal remote surgically attached.

    <p><strong>Day 3</strong>: Had to call the Smartboat people today about bandwidth problems.
      The TV drops to about 2 frames/second when I'm talking on the phone. They
      insist it's a problem with the cable company's compression algorithms.
      How do they expect me to order things from the Home Shopping Channel?

    <p><strong>Day 4</strong>: Got my first Smartboat invoice today and was unpleasantly
      surprised. I suspect the cleaning woman of reading Usenet from the
      washing machine interface when I'm not here. She must be downloading one
      hell of a lot of GIFs from the binary groups, because packet charges were
      through the roof on the invoice.

    <p><strong>Day 5</strong>: Yesterday, the galley CRASHED. Freak event. As I opened the
      refrigerator door, the light bulb blew. Immediately, everything else
      electrical shut down -- lights, microwave, coffee maker -- everything.
      Carefully unplugged and replugged all the appliances. Nothing.

    <p>Call the cable company (but not from the galley phone). They refer me to
      the utility. The utility insists that the problem is in the software. So
      the software company runs some remote telediagnostics via my boat
      processor. Their expert system claims it has to be
      the utility's fault. I don't care, I just want my galley back. More phone
      calls; more remote diag's.

    <p>Turns out the problem was "unanticipated failure mode": The network had
      never seen a refrigerator bulb failure while the door was open. So the
      fuzzy logic interpreted the burnout as a power surge and shut down the
      entire galley. But because sensor memory confirmed that there hadn't
      actually been a power surge, the galley logic sequence was confused and
      it couldn't do a standard restart. The utility guy swears this was the
      first time this has ever happened. Rebooting the galley took over an
      hour.

    <p><strong>Day 6</strong>: The marina security people are not happy. The boat keeps calling
      them for help.

    <p>We discover that whenever I play the TV or stereo above 25
      decibels, it creates patterns of micro-vibrations that get amplified
      when they hit the lexan hatches. When these vibrations mix with a gust of
      wind, the security sensors are actuated, and the marina security computer
      concludes that someone is trying to break in. Go figure.

    <p>Another glitch: Whenever the bilge is in self-diagnostic mode, the
      universal remote won't let me change the channels on my TV. That means I
      actually have to get up off the settee and change the channels by hand.
      The software and the utility people say this flaw will be fixed in the next
      upgrade -- Smartboat 2.1. But it's not ready yet.

    <p>Finally, I'm starting to suspect that the GPS is secretly tuning into the
      cable system to see Bay Watch. The unit is completely inoperable during
      that same hour. I guess I can live with that. At least the blender is not
      tuning in to old I Love Lucy episodes.

    <p><strong>Day 7</strong>: I just bought the new Microsoft Boatmanager. Took 93 gigabytes of
      storage, but it will be worth it, I think. The boat should be much easier
      to use and should really do everything. I had to sign a second mortgage
      over to Microsoft, but I don't mind: I don't really own my boat now--it's
      really the bank. Let them deal with Microsoft.

    <p><strong>Day 8</strong>: I'm beginning to have doubts about Microsoft Boatmanager. I keep
      getting an hour glass symbol showing up when I want to operate the Radar.

    <p><strong>Day 9</strong>: This is a nightmare. There's a virus in the boat. My personal
      computer caught it while browsing on the public access network. I come
      home and the main salon is a sauna, the V-berth ports are covered with
      ice, the refrigerator has defrosted, the washing machine has flooded the
      bilge, the mainsail roller-furling is cycling up and
      down and the TV is stuck on the home shopping channel. Throughout the
      boat, lights flicker like stroboscopes until they explode from the
      strain. Broken glass is everywhere.

    <p>Of course, the security sensors detect nothing.

    <p>I look at a message slowly throbbing on my personal computer screen:

      <blockquote>
    <p>WELCOME TO BoatWrecker!!! NOW THE FUN BEGINS ...
  </blockquote>

  <p>(Be it ever so humble, there's no virus like the BoatWrecker...).

  <p><strong>Day 10</strong>: They think they've digitally disinfected the boat, but the place
    is a shambles.

  <p>Pipes have burst and we're not completely sure we've got the part of the
    virus that attacks marine-heads. Nevertheless, the Exorcists (as the
    anti-virus SWAT team members like to call themselves) are confident the
    worst is over. "BoatWrecker is pretty bad" one of them tells me, "but
    consider yourself lucky you didn't get Blackbeard. That one is really
    evil."

  <p><strong>Day 11</strong>: Apparently, my boat isn't insured for viruses. "Fires and
    Hurricanes, yes," says the claims adjuster. "Viruses, no." My agreement
    with the Smartboat people explicitly states that all claims and
    warranties are null and void if any appliance or computer in my
    boat networks in any way, shape or form with a non-certified on-line
    service.

  <p>Everybody's very, very, sorry, but they can't be expected to anticipate
    every virus that might be created.

  <p>I call my lawyer. He laughs. He's excited!

  <p><strong>Day 12</strong>: I get a call from a SmartBoat sales rep. As a special offer, I
    get the free opportunity to become a beta site for the company's new
    Smartboat 2.1 upgrade. He says I'll be able to meet the programmers.
    Personally.

  <p>"Sure," I tell him.
