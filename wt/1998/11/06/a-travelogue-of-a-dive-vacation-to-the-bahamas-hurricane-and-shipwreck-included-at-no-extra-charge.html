      <h1>A Travelogue of a Dive Vacation to the Bahamas, Hurricane and Shipwreck Included at No Extra Charge</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 6, 1998</p>

    <p>I've seen my share of vessels bumping against the seawall in a blow
      and disintegrating hulks washed up on a beach. I never expected to
      actually get to watch a wreck in progress and not be able to do anything
      about it, but that's what happened while Ken &amp; I were in Bimini for
      a dive vacation.


    <p>We'd listened to the maritime weather before our trip and Hurricane
      Mitch was somewhere in Central America winding down. It was late October
      so we knew we were on the "cusp" (as it were), but things looked pretty
      good.

    <p>This dive boat was a 65 footer and carried 23 paying customers along
      with 5 crew. The plan was to do shark dives, drift dives, night
      dives... a total of 3 dives per day if possible. We'd dive, eat,
      travel, dive, eat, travel, dive, eat, sleep, etc. Sometimes part
      of the sleep time was also spent traveling.

    <p>The captain was always listening to the weather over the radio and checking
      the weather fax to determine the location of the next dive. Wind
      direction and sea conditions controlled the choices. But, it seems that
      Hurricane Mitch wasn't done yet after all. "He" decided to cut a
      path of destruction back up from Central America and head our way.
      The clouds started to take the sun away and prudence dictated we pull into
      Bimini about a day ahead of schedule. Wind and seas were building
      fast.

    <p>This little dot of land wasn't much, but it was enough to hide behind
      in a small protected bay. There was an end-tie reserved for us.
      Lots of dock lines and fenders were deployed. We could all go ashore
      and have a good time as long as we got back to the boat by midnight for
      the Captain's weather briefing.

    <p>The whole island is only a mile or so long and a few hundred feet wide.
      You can't get lost, but you can get bored if you're there for very long.
      Going ashore in Bimini consists of walking through the "marina" and heading
      left for the "End of the World Bar" or right for the hotel bar. Both
      are good hangouts, but not very exciting... unless you get turned on by
      looking at the underwear and business cards tacked to the walls and ceiling
      at End of the World Bar or smirking at the1985 photos of Gary Hart and
      his consort at the hotel bar while trying your skill at the "Ring-Ding"..

    <p>This island has been buffeted by several storms over the years.
      Once a prosperous sport fishing resort; now it's in shambles. Nothing
      looks like it's been repaired in many years and all this has taken it's
      toll on the people who call Bimini home.

      <img src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0076.JPG" ALT="IMG0076.JPG" align=right>

<p>We made the rounds, having a drink at both hot spots and walking the
      length of the island before making our way back to the boat. There
      was no announcement as promised, but it was obvious we weren't going anywhere
      just now. We slept. The wind was howling and the rain was falling
      in huge drops. From the air-conditioned comfort of of our cabin,
      we could hear nothing of all this, but we could feel the vessel bobbing
      &amp; straining against her dock lines.

    <p>Morning brought no good news. The wind was blowing 40 and gusting
      50+ on the leeward side. We weren't going anywhere soon. The seas
      would be up long after the wind quieted. That meant trying to reschedule
      our flight back to California. It took only a call to United to advise
      them we were "stuck" on Bimini... we'd work out the details of a new flight
      whenever we got back to Miami.

    <p>At least one of the other passengers had no intention of being late
      so he bought a ticket on the puddle jump pontoon plane that made a couple
      of flights a day to/from Bimini. We were in no hurry. We were
      on vacation! In the morning, after breakfast (which was rather slight
      I might add due to the prolonged trip) the Captain told us that a small
      freighter was about to drag ashore on the windward side of this tiny island.
      Wow, entertainment!

    <p>Seems the freighter, The Galant Lady, had been anchored a couple of
      miles off shore inside the reef for neatly 2 months waiting for spare parts.
      The Coast Guard plucked the remaining crew off the ship the day before
      when anchors could no longer hold against the strong winds. No one
      was left aboard.


    <p>We were across the island in about 2 minutes. We could have thrown
      a rock and hit it. It was already that close to the hard coral shoreline.
      Camera? Didn't you bring the camera? This shipwreck was imminent
      and definitely a photo op.

    <p>Even before we made it back with the camera, we heard the most horrible
      grinding, tearing, scraping sound. I can't begin to describe it.
      I could feel the "bump" through the ground under my feet. The sound
      was one that grabbed hold of you and made sure you'd remember. Almost
      immediately, the smell of diesel filled our lungs and we knew this was
      indeed the end.

    <p align=center>

  <img src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0073.JPG" ALT="IMG0073.JPG">

    <p>We ran the rest of the way through the puddles, sandy mud, and trash
      that the storm had deposited ashore until we could again see the freighter.
      One anchor line was still stretched out toward it's useless weight.
      The other had long since broken. The freighter was at an odd angle
      laid over on it's port side; steel shrieking in pain as it tore on the
      rocks. Much of the island's population turned out to watch, but not
      nearly as many as one might expect. Guess this was really a fairly
      common occurrence to them, but not to us.

    <p>Several houses and hotels in various states of disrepair or construction
      that had long ago stopped short stood silently atop the island's crest
      no more than a few hundred feet from the now wrecked ship. Next door,
      a cemetery. Perhaps a fitting resting place for what remained of
      this freighter. Depression seems to hang in the air of this island.

    <p align=center>

      <img src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0078.JPG" ALT="IMG0078.JPG">


    <p>By the next morning, pieces of the freighter had washed far up onto
      the shore as the hull continued to wallow in the surf line. What
      remained of the tender lay broken and twisted. Dented propane tanks,
      frayed line, and various unidentifiable bits of flotsam and jetsam littered
      the beach.

    <p>We took more photos and made our mental notes. People watched
      mostly in silence. As we walked along the waters edge instead of
      cutting across the island the way we had come, we came upon part of the
      life ring that had hung aboard "G nt La ".

    <p>Somehow it seemed fitting to take it back for all aboard our dive charter
      to sign and then deliver to the End of the World Bar to become part of
      the decor.

    <p>We were more than a full day late getting back to Miami. We relaxed
      in the first Class Lounge watching the TV coverage of the Space Shuttle
      landing, waiting for our new flight, and remembering.
