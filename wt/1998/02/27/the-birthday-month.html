    I must say that I've always been a believer in  the
    Birthday <em>Month</em>, but now more so than ever!  This one began with
    a late evening romantic dinner of Sushi at a Los Gatos favorite.
    I haven't had Uni this good since I gathered it myself in the
    Tuamotus.  No shortage of Saki and the waitress smiled widely
    when we asked for more Wasabi.
    <P>
      During the next 2 weeks we managed to get <em>Wishful
      Thinking's</em> engine repairs completed, modified her traveler
      system, and had a foam luff added to her Genoa.   Ken brought
      home flowers in the middle of the week claiming he  just wanted
      to avoid the  Valentines Day rush, but I know the real reason
      - it's love.
    <P>
      We were once again a <em>sailboat</em> and jonesing for
      a breeze.  Alas, the weather was NOT being cooperative.  Rain,
      rain, and more rain with too much wind.  On top of that, the car
      continued it's baffling starter problems and the mechanic actually
      agreed to fix it again on Valentines Day.  That may not sound
      so romantic, but while I camped out at the mechanics with the
      car, Ken was able to have the boat to himself and managed to finish
      the Microwave installation begun weeks before.  The &quot;Mark-II&quot;
      greatly improved on the previous shelf... that's what happens
      when you're willing to experiment with a full scale model for
      a while before committing to something permanent (a good thing).
      I brought home a large block of Sashimi grade Ahi tuna, pickled
      ginger and  an <em>I Love You</em> Valentines helium balloon.  Ananke
      immediately adopted the balloon with its long red ribboned bell
      tail and the tuna provided a taste sensation several times during
      the long weekend.  Yea, long weekend... President's Day holiday
      from the office for Ken.
    <P>
      Sunday arrived with sunshine and we finally got to
      go sailing!  The tides made us wait until afternoon, but we managed
      a short sail/test of the repairs &amp; modifications on the bay.
      This was Ananke's first actual sail.  Oh, she'd been to the
      pumpout Station several times and didn't seem to mind the noise
      of the engine, but this was different.  I guess it took her half
      an hour to come up to the cockpit and meow &quot;how come you
      two are taking so long this time?&quot;.  She wanted to go run
      around the deck so we put on her life vest.  She protested mightily
      but settled down on top of the main hatch out of the wind and
      behind the windshield so she could see.  She watched each passing
      boat and was obviously aware of that funny white thing floating
      above her head, but gave no signs of seasickness or fright...
      I think we've got a Cruising Kitty!  Ken &amp; I are definitely
      meant to sail in the Tropics though... we both got cold before
      we got back.
    <P>
      Lots of the weekend is kind of a blur.  I know we
      celebrated with a bottle of reeeeeeeally good champagne, saw the
      movie &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;, cooked up some fresh red
      snapper with lots of garlic, polished off several beers and a
      bottle of wine, did a small shopping spree at West Marine and
      ordered our new Golf Cart batteries from Sears (meant to replace
      those 2 big 8D's that aren't quite the right thing on board).
      But, one thing does stand out clearly and that is that Ken was
      only <em>wet</em> after his jump to the dock ended in a splash.  My windy
      approach to the slip on Monday after a visit to the pumpout was
      less than perfect and as he jumped a bit before he was ready...
      well shit happens.  Thankfully, he wasn't hurt and in fact was
      only wet from the waist down.  I don't know how he managed that!
      A neighbor took the docklines...
    <P>
      The next day (the 17th)was Ken's Birthday  and we
      spent a long morning in bed.  He did (eventually) go in to work.
      I planned to make his cake after he returned that night so he
      could <em>watch</em>, but we got distracted ;-) so I made it to take
      to Wednesday night Voyager/Pizza with our friends instead.

    <P>
      All this and it isn't even MY Birthday yet!!!  For
      that we had planned to get up at 0-dark-thirty and set out for
      the Berkeley Yacht Club Swap Meet to both sell &amp; buy.  Our
      friend, Mike, in Berkeley invited us to spend the night and our
      Bill &amp; Lynn invited us for a long hot bath and dinner... somehow
      the bath never happened but everything else did.  We made it to
      the swap meet only an hour late and the sun actually came out
      by 10 A M.  After the meet, we hit the big West Marine Blow Out
      Sale in Alameda before heading back to the boat for a <em>nap</em>.
      After all, we had to rest up for out evening of indulgement at
      Watercourse Way and an extravagant dinner later at MacArthur Park.
      We do believe in <em>mutual</em> presents.

    <P>
      A couple of days ago, we picked out a sewing machine
      for <em>the boat</em>...  a present for me that I can use to make lots
      of presents for Ken.

    <P>
      The month isn't over yet, but we've already decided
      that this Birthday month will extend into March and maybe even
      April!!!

    <P>
      Suzy
