      <h1>Fleet Week at Treasure Island</h1>
<p class="subtitle">October 11, 1998</p>

    <p>An eventful weekend, that's what we had.  It started Friday evening
      about 6 PM as that was our window of opportunity to escape from the
      shallows of the marina entrance in the South bay.  The winds had been
      blowing 25+ out of the north since early afternoon so it was going to
      be wet and splashy, but we really wanted to stay at Treasure Island
      Marina that night and on to Angel Island early the next morning.  So,
      it was now or never.  <strong>Wishful Thinking</strong> was actually
      the last of three to leave.  <strong>Gypsy</strong>, a Union 38, left
      about 5 PM and <strong>Dragon Lady</strong>, a Cheoy Lee 40, left
      about 5:30.  We gave them a call once we were underway.  "Hope you
      guys are reefed" came their answer.  "Reefed" I said, "hell we're
      motoring!"  "We're making fine progress just quartering these seas a
      bit and heading into the 25+ knots".</p>

    <p>When we spoke again sometime later our conditions were a bit
      better.  Theirs were not and they said they were off Coyote Point.  We
      were off SFO.  I told Ken "I guess they meant Hunter's Point".  As we
      came under the Bay Bridge on the east side of Treasure Island about 10
      PM we spoke again.  They <em>were</em> behind us!  We'd been happily berthed at
      the TI Marina for almost an hour before <strong>Dragon Lady</strong>
      pulled in.  <strong>Gypsy</strong> was bringing up the rear. (It seems
      that Darwin on the Dragon had taken the new-to-the-bay folks
      <em>through</em> all the barges moored north of the San Mateo Bridge.
      Darwin, that wasn't very nice!)  We took the west side of the bay;
      staying just left of the channel... and literally did in 4 hours what
      it took the other boats 6 hours to do.  Anyway, <strong>Gypsy</strong>
      misread the entrance to Treasure Island's Clipper Cove and wound up on
      the bar.  There's no light on the end of the pier, but there are
      <em>lots</em> of lights just as you come under the bridge.  Any hope
      of decent night vision gets destroyed.  We decided to drop our dink
      in the water and motor out to see if we could help them off.  No dice,
      but we were at least able to take their anchor out a ways.</p>

    <p>It's about time I mention Marianne (the Harbor Mistress) and her
      fianc&eacute;, Andy, who just took possession of a Morgan named
      <strong>Soy Libre</strong>.  They were gracious enough to arrange
      slips for all three of us boats on short notice.  We got a quick tour
      of their boat about midnight after returning from our rescue attempt.
      Lots of room and the forward head that has been converted into a
      workshop!  It was about 2 AM when <strong>Gypsy</strong> got off the
      mud.</p>

    <p>We planned to go on to Ayala Cove, but I got it into my head that
      we were already in the <em>perfect</em> place to watch the boat parade
      and Blue Angels show.  Over coffee I brought it up.  Ken wanted to go on
      to Ayala, but I convinced him to at least walk over to the sea wall
      and check out the view.  He also brought up the issue of keeping the
      slip longer than intended.  Yep, guess we better check that out too.
      YES!  "What a great spot to watch from!"  We get to stay "parked" and
      avoid the madhouse on the Bay!  <strong>Gypsy</strong> pulled out
      before we finished our coffee.  They were off to Ayala Cove.</p>

    <p>The boat parade started at 11 AM with fireboats, 4 <em>large</em>
      navy ships, one Canadian Navy ship that looked like a dwarf next to
      ours, and a shiny white Coast Guard Cutter.  A selection of bi-planes
      and other acrobatic planes provided the pre-Angels show.  We watched
      as we walked the length of the island (we'd never done that before).
      A large wedding party was setting up in tents along the waterfront.
      Truckloads of flowers were parked out front and the chairs and
      orchestra stands were stacked high. We found out later that this was the
      Dupont/Foss wedding and no expense had been spared.  Treasure Island
      is not so lovingly nicknamed "The Mayor's Island".  Access is strictly
      controlled on normal weekends and booked solid so I hear.  Treasure
      Island was once the home to the Worlds Fair - 1934 I think.  There's a
      poster displayed in the Marina office showing the layout during that
      spectacle.  This weekend, everyone was being allowed to wander along
      the length of the west side of the island.  Parking spots were going
      for $10 bucks and fast food stands dotted the walkways.  The Mayor's
      Police Force was everywhere (mostly chasing cars off that tried to
      stop along the sea wall to watch the show).</p>

    <p>Here's a trivia question for you... in what movie did a Treasure
      Island building appear as a wartime Germany airport terminal??? <a
        href="#answer">[answer]</a></p>

    <p>By 2 PM, we decided that a nap was in order.  The sound of the Blue
      Angels would surely wake us up for the 3 PM show!  That's exactly what
      happened.  The sea wall was indeed a perfect vantage point.  A late
      lunch and another nap (for Ken) while I enjoyed a glass of wine with
      Mary from <strong>Dragon Lady</strong>.  Ken soon joined us and we
      told of our plans to <em>crash</em> the wedding later.  Actually, we
      just planned to find a spot outside to listen to the music, but as it
      turned out....</p>

    <p>Having friends in low places is quite a good thing.  We went to get
      Marianne and Andy about the same time that Bob
      came to get them... John Lee Hooker was also scheduled to play!  We
      had no problem getting inside the secure area and staking out a spot
      just outside the clear-sided tent.  We had a great view of the bay and
      the back of the orchestra.  11:30 rolled around and the orchestra was
      still playing.  John Lee was wandering back in forth letting folks
      have their picture taken with him and doing a bit of singing in the
      street, but we gave up and went to bed before he ever went on stage
      :-(</p>

    <img align=right src="/assets/img/pcd0644/IMG0006.JPG" ALT="Before the jet wash hit us">
    <p>Sunday morning we decided to sleep late and dinghy around the
      anchorage before the sail back to Redwood.  Once again, tides matter!
      I guess we were underway by 13:00 sailing up around the north end of
      TI so we could sail south around the east side and enjoy that day's
      show during the sail.  Our timing was great, as the Blue Angels had
      just started their show.  About the time we were directly in front of
      all the people watching from the TI sea wall, we were overflown by one
      of the Angels at low altitude.  I was snapping pictures like crazy and
      the cat was curled up in the cockpit.  The plane came right at us from
      over TI a couple hundred feet off the water.  Wow!  What a rush!  Ken
      was driving and saying things like "Cool", "I can see the vortex", and
      "OH SH*T" as the jet wash knocked <strong>Wishful Thinking</strong> on
      her ear for about 10 seconds.  Water was coming into the cockpit over
      the port side and the cat was doing her best to get back down below
      where it was safe.  It was most exhilarating!!!</p>

    <p>No harm done but we called Marianne to say "Did you see
      that?!??!!!"  Indeed she had (along with everyone else that had a
      ringside seat on TI)!  We hadn't planned on becoming part of the show
      ourselves.  I sure hope someone took our picture!  Maybe it'll just
      show up in Lat 38.</p>
